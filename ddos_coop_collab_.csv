"Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have emerged as a major threat to the stability of the Internet. By the very nature of the DDoS attacks, pure preventive and pure reactive approaches are not effective to defend against them. We propose a global defense infrastructure to detect-and-respond to the DDoS attacks. This infrastructure consists of a network of distributed local detection systems (LDSes), which detect attacks and respond to them cooperatively. Because of the current Internet topology, this infrastructure can be very effective even if only a small number of major backbone ISPs participate in this infrastructure by installing fully configured LDSes. Moreover, we propose to use traffic volume anomaly for DDoS attack detection. A fully configured LDS monitors the passing traffic for an abnormally high volume of traffic destined to an IP host. A DDoS attack is confirmed if multiple LDSes have detected such anomalies at the same time. Our simulation studies have demonstrated that the proposed detection algorithms are responsive and effective in curbing DDoS attacks. © 2002 IEEE.",10.1109/ICON.2002.1033348,2-s2.0-33745278421,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33745278421&origin=inward,,27.0,Engineering of a global defense infrastructure for DDoS attacks,2002
"© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.The amount of wireless traffic is increasing at an overwhelming speed. Information-centric networking (ICN) has been proposed as a promising Future Internet Architecture, which can reduce network traffic by putting data objects toward the edge. It is expected that in information-centric mobile Internet (ICMI), the wireless traffic can be significantly reduced. Yet, DoS/DDoS attack becomes a critical issue in ICMI by causing wireless gateway blockade. To tackle the problem, we propose a dual-collaborative DoS/DDoS mitigation approach (DCMA) and advanced DCMA to protect wireless gateways. In the algorithm, the attackers' visiting information including international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) and data object name (DON) are analyzed jointly to accurately identify potential attackers through the collaboration between the Internet and mobile network. In addition, the attacker's behaviors are analyzed centrally, and security strategies are applied distributively throughout wireless edge through the collaboration between wireless core network (CN) and radio access network (RAN). Extensive simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The results demonstrate that advanced DCMA can achieve high DDoS and attacker detection probability and small false positive probability.",10.1002/dac.4241,2-s2.0-85075171039,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85075171039&origin=inward,,0.0,Dual-collaborative DoS/DDoS mitigation approach in information-centric mobile Internet,2020
"© 2014 IEEE.A domain name system (DNS) is one of the most important infrastructures of the Internet communication. It is also a crucial point which is subjected to attacks. The largest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on October 21, 2016 has targeted a major DNS infrastructure named dynDNS. It was actually the Internet of Things (IoT) DNS flood attack that made more than half of websites in the United States unreachable for a significant amount of time. As we are using the Internet for everything in our life, especially health care and transportation, an attack of this type may cause a major disruption. Therefore, in this article, we are going to analyze the DNS flood attacks and propose two mitigation methods. We propose a load distributed mitigation process which will work as a quick escape route of the legitimate traffic from the attack field. Our solution mainly involves service level changes which can be implemented with collaboration among service providers. Also, our proposed solution is very cost effective as compared to the cost of downtime of the domain names caused by a DNS flood attack. Furthermore, we propose a benign-bot mitigation method and a business model for the method. In the benign-bot mitigation method, a bot program is installed in customers' DNS local servers to allow IP addresses of a list of paid businesses' websites to maintain in the caches so that the websites can be accessed even when the DNS servers are down.",10.1109/JIOT.2019.2947659,2-s2.0-85079754375,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079754375&origin=inward,,0.0,Load Distributed and Benign-Bot Mitigation Methods for IoT DNS Flood Attacks,2020
"As more and more services are provided by servers via the Internet, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks pose an increasing threat to the Internet community. A DoS attack overloads the target server with a large volume of adverse requests, thereby rendering the server unavailable to well-behaved users. In this paper, we propose two algorithms that allow attack targets to dynamically filter their incoming traffic based on a distributed policy. The proposed algorithms defend the target against DoS and distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks and simultaneously ensure that it continues to serve well-behaved users. In a nutshell, a target can define a filtering policy which consists of a set of traffic classification rules and the corresponding amounts of traffic for each rule. A filtering algorithm is enforced by the ISP's routers when a target is being overloaded with traffic. The goal is to maximize the amount of filtered traffic forwarded to the target, according to the filtering policy, from the ISP. The first proposed algorithm is a collaborative algorithm which computes and delivers to the target the best possible traffic mix in polynomial time. The second algorithm is a distributed non-collaborative algorithm for which we prove a lower bound on the worst-case performance. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.",10.1142/S012905411100857X,2-s2.0-80051675657,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80051675657&origin=inward,,0.0,Trawling traffic under attack overcoming ddos attacks by target-controlled traffic filtering,2011
"© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most prevalent attacks on the internet today which attacks the availability of the server by resource and bandwidth depletion exhaustion. Many mechanisms exist to fight against DDoS attack, a set of which are the cooperative defense mechanisms which work in a distributed manner and are more robust. This work makes use of one of the latest meta-heuristic optimization techniques, Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to find underutilized internet cache servers which are in best position to absorb DDoS flood. These multiple caches will absorb a part of the attack flood thus preventing the victim’s network from getting congested. For effective allocation of these cache resources a Continuous Double Auction (CDA) mechanism is applied. It is more flexible and efficient as it allows simultaneous bidding by sellers and buyers. The cache servers are selected through multi-objective WOA in MATLAB and then the auction platform is set-up using Actor Model. In cooperative defense, selection of a pricing strategy which maximizes collateral profit is very important so a round-wise bidding strategy is implemented which promotes long-term participation. For evaluation of the scheme, the workload traces of distributed servers are used to generate three scenarios under different attack load conditions. Depending on the supply-demand of free cache resources, the results show that the proposed algorithm has high detection rate of close optimum solutions. This leads to increased throughput because the attack traffic is not only shared, but is shared in a balanced way.",10.1007/978-981-13-3143-5_33,2-s2.0-85058291104,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058291104&origin=inward,,0.0,Cooperative Mitigation of DDoS Attacks Using an Optimized Auction Scheme on Cache Servers,2019
"Cloud computing is used extensively to deliver utility computing over the Internet. Defending network acces-sible Cloud resources and services from various threats and attacks is of great concern. Intrusion Detection Sys-tem (IDS) has become popular as an important network security technology to detect cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative IDS (CIDS) Framework for cloud. We use Snort to detect the known stealthy attacks using signature matching. To detect unknown at-tacks, anomaly detection system (ADS) is built using De-cision Tree Classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

"The resource constraint characteristic of sensor nodes make wireless sensor networks (WSN) very vulnerable to resource depletion attack such as DoS/DDos attack. On the other hand, the resource constraint characteristic also makes anomaly detection a challenging problem in WSN. To address the challenge, this paper presents an anomaly detection framework by taking the advantages of artificial immune system (AIS) and fuzzy theory. The proposed framework incorporates three components: local danger sensing, co-stimulation and global recognition. Due to the hierarchical structure and cooperative mechanism, the proposed model shows more advantages in detection performance than conventional method. The simulation results show that compared to watchdog method, the proposed method can provide higher detection rate and lower false detection rate. Moreover, the propose method shows advantages in flexibility and adaptability. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.",10.4304/jnw.7.8.1214-1219,2-s2.0-84866051331,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84866051331&origin=inward,,7.0,Biologically inspired anomaly detection for hierarchical wireless sensor networks,2012
"Distributed denial of service is flooding of network with unrelated information by malicious node in network. These causes an authorized services deny from user. Thus poses a major security threat in network. The mitigation of denial of service become hard when it comes to distributed environment. Denial of service can be of any form either ping of death or clone attack. In existing system these can be overcome using filtering technique namely blackhole and sinkhole. Filtering malicious traffic can be integrated with firewall hardware or software. Firecol act as an intrusion prevention system which prevent the network attack using IPS rules. This form a virtual mitigation shield around the network by clusters of IPS system. The above mentioned attack can be detected using honeypot, an IDS(intrusion detection system).

"Cloud computing provides a framework for supporting end users easily attaching powerful services and applications through Internet. To provide secure and reliable services in cloud computing environment is an important issue. One of the security issues is how to reduce the impact of denial-of-service (DoS) attack or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) in this environment. To counter these kinds of attacks, a framework of cooperative intrusion detection system (IDS) is proposed. The proposed system could reduce the impact of these kinds of attacks. To provide such ability, IDSs in the cloud computing regions exchange their alerts with each other. In the system, each of IDSs has a cooperative agent used to compute and determine whether to accept the alerts sent from other IDSs or not. By this way, IDSs could avoid the same type of attack happening. The implementation results indicate that the proposed system could resist DoS attack. Moreover, by comparison, the proposed cooperative IDS system only increases little computation effort compared with pure Snort based IDS but prevents the system from single point of failure attack. © 2010 IEEE.",10.1109/ICPPW.2010.46,2-s2.0-78649815408,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78649815408&origin=inward,,138.0,A cooperative intrusion detection system framework for cloud computing networks,2010
"© 2015 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.In Today's Digital World, the continuous interruption of users has affected Web Servers (WSVRs), through Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks always remain a massive warning to the World Wide Web (WWW). These warnings can interrupt the accessibility of WSVRs, completely by disturbing each data processing before intercommunication properties over pure dimensions of Data-Driven Networks (DDN), management and cooperative communities on the Internet technology. The purpose of this research is to find, describe and test existing tools and features available in Linux-based solution lab design Availability Protection System (Linux-APS), for filtering malicious traffic flow of DDoS attacks. As source of malicious traffic flow takes most widely used DDoS attacks, targeting WSVRs. Synchronize (SYN), User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Flooding attacks are described and different variants of the mitigation techniques are explained. Available cooperative tools for manipulating with network traffic, like; Ebtables and Iptables tools are compared, based on each type of attacks. Specially created experimental network was used for testing purposes, configured filters servers and bridge. Inspected packets flow through Linux-kernel network stack along with tuning options serving for increasing filter server traffic throughput. In the part of contribution as an outcomes, Ebtables tool appears to be most productive, due to less resources it needed to process each packet (frame).

"Software-defined networks (SDN), an emergent paradigm for network management, define abstractions to represent network entities and logically centralize them in a network controller. We argue that SDN's abstraction is the most promising way to successfully create agent-based architectures to control and manage large-scale parts of the Internet. This article makes a strong case for these architectures by introducing a framework that integrates autonomous networks and SDN. First, we define autonomous SDN by complementary features of agent frameworks and those of SDN. Then we describe our agent approach, called AgNOS, which builds cooperative SDNs that extend their domains beyond enterprise networks. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we present a case study on an important open issue of the Internet: mitigation of DDoS attacks when thousands of attackers perform malicious packet flooding and SDN domains must cooperate to cope with packet filtering at the source. © 2014 IEEE.",10.1109/AINA.2014.114,2-s2.0-84903827722,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84903827722&origin=inward,,11.0,AgNOS: A framework for autonomous control of software-defined networks,2014
"Global Information Grid (GIG) operations would benefit greatly from improved support for virtual machines (VMs) that can migrate not only between physical devices within a datacentre, but also between physical devices located on different continents, while maintaining their existing IP communications sessions. Such VM migration can enable improvements with: CPU load-balancing, network traffic-engineering, distributed denial of service (DDoS) mitigation, fault-tolerance, and resilience. Existing migration approaches often require complex network configuration and management, may often require use of expensive proprietary technologies, and also often require active cooperation from upstream service providers. We describe a VM mobility approach that enables datacentre operators to directly and unilaterally provide and control intra-site and wide-area VM mobility. We present several use cases with different degrees of location transparency.

"Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks present serious threats to servers in the Internet. They can exhaust critical resources at a target host with the help of a large number of compromised Internet hosts and hence deny services to legitimate clients. This paper studies some existing schemes for the detection and defense against TCP-based DDoS attacks. We propose a distributed scheme that can mitigate the damage caused by DDoS through a coordinated detection and response framework. This proposed scheme composes of a number of heterogeneous defense systems which cooperate with each other in protecting Internet servers. We have set up a network testbed for carrying out extensive experiments using real server machines, routers and software attack tools. Experimental results show that, compared to existing schemes, our proposed scheme can greatly improve the throughput of legitimate traffic and reduce the attack traffic during DDoS attacks. To investigate the scale-up behavior of our scheme, we have also developed a software simulator for largerscale experiments. Simulation results show that our scheme performs consistently well even in networks with more than 3000 nodes and under high traffic load. © 2006 IEEE.",10.1109/ICC.2006.255091,2-s2.0-42549129280,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=42549129280&origin=inward,,17.0,A coordinated detection and response scheme for distributed denial-of-service attacks,2006
"© 2017 IEEE.Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a promising solution for addressing challenges of future networks. Despite its advantages such as flexibility, simplification and low costs, it has several drawbacks that are largely induced by the centralized control paradigm. Security is one of the most significant challenges related to centralization. In that regard, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose crucial security questions in software-defined networks. In SDN architecture, switches send all packets to the controller if they do not have any applicable rules in their flow tables. Basically, controller is the key place that can take initiative in decisions. However, this characteristic results in large communication overhead and delay until a DDoS attack is detected and an appropriate action is activated against attack packets. Therefore, in this work we propose a hybrid mechanism, namely SDNScore, where switches are not simply data forwarders. Instead, they can collect statistics and decide if DDoS attack is in action. Then they coordinate with the controller and act on attack packets in cooperation. SDNScore is a statistical and packet-based defense mechanism against DDoS attacks in SDN environment. Since it has a statistical scoring method, it can detect not only known but also unknown attacks entailing packets that are alike in terms of TCP and IP layer properties. In addition, it does not drop all packets in a flow which includes both attack and legal packets, but rather filters out attack packets using packet-based analysis.",10.1109/ISCC.2017.8024605,2-s2.0-85030554390,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85030554390&origin=inward,,14.0,SDNScore: A statistical defense mechanism against DDoS attacks in SDN environment,2017

"Security threats for the network services have been constantly increasing day by day. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one such kind of security threat which involves multiple systems generating a large amount of traffic towards a target machine and thereby making any service from that target machine or server unavailable to its clients. This threat by nature needs no control over the target system. Traditional methods of detecting DDoS attacks are mostly centralized in nature and highly disadvantageous. To overcome the disadvantages of those schemes, we propose a distributed methodology which involves installing the attack detectors at various parts of the network. Each router in the network will monitor the traffic flowing through it and if any anomaly in the traffic pattern is detected, it will raise an alarm to the nearby routers. The alarm propagates to all the routers through which the attack flows. By this way a tree like construct is made, which will have information about number of alarms raised and the path of the attack flow. If the construct shows any converging pattern then it is declared as DDoS attack. © 2011 IEEE.",10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972338,2-s2.0-80052249034,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=80052249034&origin=inward,,1.0,CoDe - An collaborative detection algorithm for DDoS attacks,2011
"Game-theoretic approaches have been previously employed in the research area of network security in order to explore the interaction between an attacker and a defender during a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack scenario. Existing literature investigates payoffs and optimal strategies for both parties, in order to provide the defender with an optimal defence strategy. In this paper, we model a DDoS attack as a one-shot, non-cooperative, zero-sum game. We extend previous work by incorporating in our model a richer set of options available to the attacker compared to what has been previously achieved. We investigate multiple permutations in terms of the cost to perform an attack, the number of attacking nodes, malicious traffic probability distributions and their parameters. We analytically demonstrate that there exists a single optimal strategy available to the defender. By adopting it, the defender sets an upper boundary to attacker payoff, which can only be achieved if the attacker is a rational player. For all other attack strategies (those adopted by irrational attackers), attacker payoff will be lower than this boundary. We preliminary validate this model via simulations with the ns2 network simulator. The simulated environment replicates the analytical model's parameters and the results confirm our model's accuracy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.cose.2013.03.014,2-s2.0-84885184956,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84885184956&origin=inward,,46.0,A game theoretic defence framework against DoS/DDoS cyber attacks,2013

"Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is a major threat to the availability of Internet services. The anonymity allowed by IP networking, together with the distributed, large scale nature of the Internet, makes DDoS attacks stealthy and difficult to counter. To make the problem worse, attack traffic is often indistinguishable from normal traffic. As various attack tools become widely available and require minimum knowledge to operate, automated anti-DDoS systems become increasingly important. Many current solutions are either excessively expensive or require universal deployment across many administrative domains. This paper proposes two perimeter-based defense mechanisms for Internet service providers (ISPs) to provide the anti-DDoS service to their customers. These mechanisms rely completely on the edge routers to cooperatively identify the flooding sources and establish rate-limit filters to block the attack traffic. The system does not require any support from routers outside or inside of the ISP, which not only makes it locally deployable, but also avoids the stress on the ISP core routers. We also study a new problem of perimeter-based IP traceback and provide three solutions. We demonstrate analytically and by simulations that the proposed defense mechanisms react quickly in blocking attack traffic while achieving high survival ratio for legitimate traffic. Even when 40 percent of all customer networks attack, the survival ratio for traffic from the other customer networks is still close to 100 percent. © 2005 IEEE.",10.1109/TPDS.2005.74,2-s2.0-21244446746,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=21244446746&origin=inward,,56.0,Perimeter-based defense against high bandwidth DDoS attacks,2005
"© 2018, Zarka Private University. All rights reserved.Distributed denial of service attack has become a challenging threat in today’s Internet. The adversaries often use spoofed IP addresses, which in turn makes the defense process very difficult. The sophistication of the attack is increasing due to the difficulty in tracing back the origin of attack. The researchers have contributed many traceback schemes to find out the origin of such attacks. In the majority of the existing methods they either mark the packets or log the hash digest of the packets at the routers in the attack path, which is computational and storage intensive. The proposed IP trace back scheme is an User Datagram Protocolbased (UDP) approach using packet marking which requires computation and storage only at the edge router and victim and hence it does not overload the intermediate routers in the attack path. Unlike existing traceback schemes which requires numerous packets to traceback an attacker, the proposed scheme requires only a single trace information marked packet to identify an attacker. It supports incremental deployment which is a desirable characteristic of a practical traceback scheme. The work was simulated with real time Internet dataset from the Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) and found that the storage requirement at the victim is less than 1.2 MB which is nearly 3413 times lesser than the existing related packet marking method.

We suggest an enhancement to make the 3-way handshake in SCTF stateless and call it Fast-SCTF. We then propose a framework using BGP for a single-packet handshake.We demonstrate that our proposed scheme is space efficient, more secure, robust and it requires very little cooperation among autonomous systems.",,2-s2.0-79851496296,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79851496296&origin=inward,,5.0,Defeating reflector based denial-of-service attacks using single packet filters,2010
"The main aim is to provide energy efficiency for cooperative multi channel MAC protocols by using DISH strategies. Distributed Information SHaring (DISH) is a new cooperative approach to designing multichannel MAC protocols. It aids nodes in their decision making processes by compensating for their missing information via information sharing through neighbouring nodes. This approach was recently shown to significantly boost the throughput of multichannel MAC protocols. However, a critical issue for ad hoc communication devices, viz. energy efficiency, has yet to be addressed. In this project, address this issue by developing simple solutions that reduce the energy consumption without compromising the throughput performance and meanwhile maximize cost efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/ICICES.2013.6508259,2-s2.0-84879873098,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84879873098&origin=inward,,0.0,Energy conservation and DDOS detection using intelligent node in mobile adhoc network,2013
"© 2013 IEEE.Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is the process of monitoring the events that occur in a system or network and process them for possible intrusions where as Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) has the capability to attempt to stop such possible intrusions.

"Flooding based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can cause very serious security problem by exhausting computing and bandwidth resources of victims. To mitigate these destructive attacks, it is crucially important to detect the occurrence of DDoS attacks and identify their targets as early as possible. In this paper, we propose a collaborative DDoS detection system, called VicSifter, which can detect ongoing DDoS attacks and identify victims at an early stage with good scalability and low overhead. VicSifter is deployed over multiple nodes with two kinds of functions: local anomaly detection and collaborative victim identification. The anomaly detection method is performed locally and is lightweight to save computation by measuring passing packets in a sketch. The collaborative victim identification is triggered only when a local anomaly is detected by employing our distinctive elimination mechanism. The mechanism can significantly reduce the number of packets to be processed by each node, making our system scalable for high-speed network links. We evaluate the performance of VicSifter by using real-world data traffic, mixing the real DDoS attack traces with captured campus gateway traffic. The results show that our system has high accuracy in the early detection of DDoS attacks and timely identification of targeted victims. Our system can outperform other existing methods with less space requirement, and thus achieving good system scalability. © 2012 IEEE.",10.1109/TrustCom.2012.295,2-s2.0-84868098039,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84868098039&origin=inward,,9.0,VicSifter: A collaborative DDoS detection system with lightweight victim identification,2012

However, up to now little is known about the nature of the amplification sources and about countermeasures one can take to remediate these vulnerable systems. Is there any hope in mitigating the amplification problem? In this paper, we aim to answer this question and tackle the problem from four different angles. In a first step, we monitored and classified amplification sources, showing that amplifiers have a high diversity in terms of operating systems and architectures. Based on these results, we then collaborated with the security community in a large-scale campaign to reduce the number of vulnerable NTP servers by more than 92%. To assess possible next steps of attackers, we evaluate amplification vulnerabilities in the TCP handshake and show that attackers can abuse millions of hosts to achieve 20x amplification. Lastly, we analyze the root cause for amplification attacks: networks that allow IP address spoofing.

"© 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.Distributed DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks, or say DDoS attacks, have reportedly caused the most serious losses in recent years and such attacks are getting worse. How to efficiently detect DDoS attacks has naturally become one of the hottest topics in the cyber security community and many approaches have been proposed. The existing detection technologies, however, have their own weak points. For example, methods based on information theory must choose an information theoretic measures carefully which play an essential role on the detection performance and such methods are efficient only when there are a significantly large number of anomalies present in the data; signature-based methods can not deal with new kinds of attacks and new variants of existing attacks, and so on. The behavior-based ones have been thought to be promising. However, they often need some parameters to define the normal nodes and such parameters cannot be determined easily in advance in many actual situations. In our previous work, an algorithm without parameters was proposed for extracting normal nodes from the historic traffic data. In this paper, we will explain a practical off-line detection system for DDoS attacks that we developed based on that algorithm in a project called PRACTICE (Proactive Response Against Cyber-attacks Through International Collaborative Exchange).

"IP spoofing has often been exploited by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to: 1) conceal flooding sources and dilute localities in flooding traffic, and 2) coax legitimate hosts into becoming reflectors, redirecting and amplifying flooding traffic. Thus, the ability to filter spoofed IP packets near victim servers is essential to their own protection and prevention of becoming involuntary DoS reflectors. Our scheme is based on a firewall that can distinguish the attack packets (containing spoofed source addresses) from the packets sent by legitimate users, and thus filters out most of the attack packets before they reach the victim. We estimate that an implementation of this scheme would require the cooperation of only about 20% of the Internet routers in the marking process. The scheme allows the firewall system to configure itself based on the normal traffic of a Web server, so that the occurrence of an attack can be quickly and precisely detected. By this cryptographic approach, we aim at combining both the existing approaches namely, Victim Based and Router Based approaches against IP spoofing thereby enhancing the speed of detection and prevention of IP spoofed packed. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",10.1007/978-3-642-12214-9-47,2-s2.0-77950553020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77950553020&origin=inward,,2.0,A cryptographic approach to defend against IP spoofing,2010

This paper proposes an autonomic DDoS defense framework, called ArOMA, that leverages the programmability and centralized manageability features of Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm. Specifically, ArOMA can systematically bridge the gaps between different security functions, ranging from traffic monitoring to anomaly detection to mitigation, while sparing human operators from non-trivial interventions. It also facilitates the collaborations between ISPs and their customers on DDoS mitigation by logically distributing the essential security functions, allowing the ISP to handle DDoS traffic based on the requests of its customers.

"The basis of denial of service (DoS)/distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks lies in overwhelming a victim’s computer resources by flooding them with enormous traffic. This is done by compromising multiple systems that send a high volume of traffic. The traffic is often formulated in such a way that it consumes finite resources at abnormal rates either at victim or network level. In addition, spoofing of source addresses makes it difficult to combat such attacks. This paper adopts a twofold collaborative mechanism, wherein the intermediate routers are engaged in markings and the victim uses these markings for detecting and filtering the flooding attacks. The markings are used to distinguish the legitimate network traffic from the attack so as to enable the routers near the victim to filter the attack packets. The marked packets are also helpful to backtrack the true origin of the spoofed traffic, thus dropping them at the source rather than allowing them to traverse the network. To further aid in the detection of spoofed traffic, Time to Live (TTL) in the IP header is used. The mappings between the IP addresses and the markings along with the TTLs are used to find the spurious traffic. We provide numerical and simulated experimental results to show the effectiveness of the proposed system in distinguishing the legitimate traffic from the spoofed. We also give a statistical report showing the performance of our system. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",10.1080/19393550802676071,2-s2.0-84868097584,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84868097584&origin=inward,,3.0,"Collaborative framework for detection, prevention, and traceback of flooding attacks using marking and filtering",2009
"© 2018 Elsevier LtdIn the present computer era, though the Internet-based applications are the driving force of social evolution, yet its architectural vulnerabilities proffer plethoric leisure to the attackers for conquering diversity of attacks on its services. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of such prominent attack that constitutes a lethal threat to Internet domain that harnesses its computing and communication resources. Despite the presence of enormous defense solutions, ensuring the security and availability of data, resources, and services to end users remains an ongoing research challenge. In addition, the increase in network traffic rates of legitimate traffic and flow similarity of attack traffic with legitimate traffic has further made DDoS problem more crucial. The current research has deployed DDoS defense solutions primarily at the victim-end because of the inherent advantages of easy deployment and availability of complete attack information. However, the huge network traffic volume generated by DDoS attacks and lack of sufficient computational resources at the victim-end makes defense solution itself vulnerable to these attacks. This paper proposes an ISP level distributed, flexible, automated, and collaborative (D-FACE) defense system which not only distributes the computational and storage complexity to the nearest point of presence (PoPs) routers but also leads to an early detection of DDoS attacks and flash events (FEs).

"© 2013 IEEE.The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one of the most server threats to the current Internet and brings huge losses to society. Furthermore, it is challenging to defend DDoS due to the case that the DDoS traffic can appear similar to the legitimate ones. Router throttling is an accessible approach to defend DDoS attacks. Some existing router throttling methods dynamically adjust a given threshold value to keep the server load safe. However, these methods are not ideal as they exploit the information of the current time, so the perception of time series variations is poor. The DDoS problem can be seen as a Markov decision process (MDP). Multi-agent router throttling (MART) method based on hierarchical communication mechanism has been proposed to address this problem. However, each agent is independent with each other and has no communication among them, therefore, it is hard for them to collaborate to learn an ideal policy to defend DDoS. To solve this multi-agent partially observable MDP problem, we propose a centralized reinforcement learning router throttling method based on a centralized communication mechanism. Each router sends its own traffic reading to a central router, the central router then makes a decision for each router to choose the throttling rate. We also simulate the environment of the DDoS problem more realistic while modify the reward function of the MART to make the reward function of more coherent. To decrease the communication costs, we add a deep deterministic policy gradient network for each router to decide whether or not to send information to the central agent. The experiments validate that our proposed new smart router throttling method outperforms existing methods to the DDoS instruction response.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930803,2-s2.0-85071191158,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071191158&origin=inward,,0.0,A New Smart Router-Throttling Method to Mitigate DDoS Attacks,2019
"Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks pose a serious threat to Internet security. Most current research focuses on detection and prevention methods on the victim server or source side. To date, there has been no work on defenses using valuable information from the innocent client whose IP has been used in attacking packets. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative system for producing warning of a DDoS attack. The system consists of a client detector and a server detector. The client detector is placed on the innocent client side and uses a Bloom filter-based detection scheme to generate accurate detection results yet consumes minimal storage and computational resources. The server detector can actively assist the warning process by sending requests to innocent hosts. Simulation results show that the cooperative technique presented in this paper can yield accurate DDoS alarms at an early stage.

"© 2004-2012 IEEE.Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks continue to trouble network operators and service providers, and with increasing intensity. Effective response to DDoS can be slow (because of manual diagnosis and interaction) and potentially self-defeating (as indiscriminate filtering accomplishes a likely goal of the attacker), and this is the result of the discrepancy between the service provider's flow-based, application-level view of traffic and the network operator's packet-based, network-level view and limited functionality. Furthermore, a network required to take action may be in an autonomous system (AS) several AS-hops away from the service, so it has no direct relationship with the service on whose behalf it acts.

"Network attacks, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and Internet worms, are highly distributed and well coordinated offensive assaults on services, hosts, and the infrastructure of the Internet, and can have disastrous effects including financial losses and disruption of essential services. Consequently, effective defensive countermeasures against these attacks must provide equally sophisticated and well coordinated mechanisms for monitoring, analysis, and response. In this paper, we investigate techniques for cooperative attack detection and countermeasures using decentralized information sharing. The key underlying idea is the use of epidemic algorithms to share attack information and achieve quasi-global knowledge about attack behaviors. This paper first presents a conceptual model that defines the relationships between the level of knowledge in the distributed system and the accuracy of attack detection. The design of a cooperative attack detection and defense framework is then presented, and its use for detecting and defending against DDoS attacks and Internet worms is described. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the framework against these attacks. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC., 2010.",10.1007/s10586-009-0116-9,2-s2.0-77649232304,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77649232304&origin=inward,,18.0,Cooperative detection and protection against network attacks using decentralized information sharing,2010

"Massive Internet invasions implemented through the distributed platform fabricated by rapid diffusion of malwares, has become a significant issue in network security. We argue that the notion of ""Collaborative Security"" is an emerging trend in resisting distributed attacks originated from malware. Therefore, this paper proposes a new architecture: CloudSEC, for composing collaborative security-related services in clouds, such as correlated intrusion analysis, anti-spam, anti-DDOS, automated malware detection and containment. CloudSEC is modeled as a dynamic peer-to-peer overlay hierarchy with three types of top-down architectural components. Based on this architecture, both data distribution and task scheduling overlays can be simultaneously implemented in a loosely coupled fashion, which can efficiently retrieve data resources from heterogeneous network security facilities, and harness distributed collection of computational resources to process data-intensive tasks. Hence, CloudSEC endues the network security infrastructure with the capability of dynamic adaptation and collaboration on an inter-organizational scale. The results of preliminary evaluation demonstrate that, CloudSEC not only delivers a sample service of distributed intrusion correlation with high scalability and robustness, but also achieves remarkable effectiveness in data sharing and task scheduling. © 2010 IEEE.",10.1109/CloudCom.2010.16,2-s2.0-79952409740,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79952409740&origin=inward,,15.0,CloudSEC: A cloud architecture for composing collaborative security services,2010
"To prevent the DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks effectively, a cooperative detection model was proposed based on the cooperation among the IDSs (intrusion detection systems) distributed in multiple administrative domains. Surrounding some valuable network assets, the enclosed defense ring was set up that consists of (IDS, Router) pairs with the IDS monitoring specific router traffic. The IDSs reside in the ring were allotted to a cooperation group. With the information exchanging and alert correlating within the group, the signatures of DDoS attacks aimed at the network assets could be captured timely before the overwhelming attack flooding aggregates.

"© 2017 Elsevier LtdComputer networks are critical to many tasks in our daily lives. Therefore, mechanisms that guarantee the resilience of the network must be provided. Different approaches have been proposed to address potential challenges to network operation, but they rely on rigid solutions, which work only in anticipated scenarios. To address this issue, this paper presents BDI2DoS, which is a multi-agent innovative application that ensures the resilience of networks against the widely known Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. We take an existing network resilience strategy based on event–condition–action (ECA) policies to combat DDoS attacks, and use it as a requirement to specify the behaviour that must emerge from the interaction among agents, which together are capable of detecting and remediating anomalies that are considered a DDoS threat, in a flexible way. Agents in our multi-agent system follow the widely used BDI architecture, and were implemented with the BDI4JADE agent platform. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of BDI2DoS, we used the PReSET resilience simulator and BDI4JADE to build an integrated testbed.

"The vulnerabilities in the Communication (TCP/IP) protocol stack and the availability of more sophisticated attack tools breed in more and more network hackers to attack the network intentionally or unintentionally, leading to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The DDoS attacks could be detected using the existing machine learning techniques such as neural classifiers. These classifiers lack generalization capabilities which result in less performance leading to high false positives. This paper evaluates the performance of a comprehensive set of machine learning algorithms for selecting the base classifier using the publicly available KDD Cup dataset. Based on the outcome of the experiments, Resilient Back Propagation (RBP) was chosen as base classifier for our research. The improvement in performance of the RBP classifier is the focus of this paper. Our proposed classification algorithm, RBPBoost, is achieved by combining ensemble of classifier outputs and Neyman Pearson cost minimization strategy, for final classification decision. Publicly available datasets such as KDD Cup, DARPA 1999, DARPA 2000, and CONFICKER were used for the simulation experiments. RBPBoost was trained and tested with DARPA, CONFICKER, and our own lab datasets. Detection accuracy and Cost per sample were the two metrics evaluated to analyze the performance of the RBPBoost classification algorithm. From the simulation results, it is evident that RBPBoost algorithm achieves high detection accuracy (99.4%) with fewer false alarms and outperforms the existing ensemble algorithms.

"Security, and in particular reactive protection against network attacks and anomalies, is a major concern of modern networks. This paper presents ""FireCircle"", a novel security provisioning service that allows the administrators of a downstream network to inject firewall-like rules at their upstream level and mitigate attacks there; under certain circumstances these rules can be further propagated so that attacks are mitigated even closer to their sources. FireCircle has been designed and implemented by GRNET Network Operations Center, using hardware that supports RFC5575 (a.k.a BGP flow-spec), open-source tools and platforms and software developed in-house. The BGP nature of the service makes it quick, scalable, manageable, secure and multidomain. FIreCircle adds to this mechanism a web administrative and user interface, a programmatic API, strong and scalable authentication mechanisms (Shibboleth), advanced and flexible authorization schemes and self-protection anti-measures, all packed under an open-source licence. These features allow the service not only meet its primary goals, that is the easy mitigation of attacks by personnel with medium networking expertise and low-end equipment, but also open potentials for integration with network anomaly detection tools and promote synergies between peering domains or cooperating security teams. This paper covers the aforementioned points, providing details about the architecture, the implementation, the deployment on GRNET production network and the future plans of the service.

"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can be so powerful that they can easily deplete the computing resources or bandwidth of the potential targets. Based on the types of the targets, DDoS attacks can be addressed in two levels: application-level and network-level. Taking the network-based applications into consideration, a weak point is that they commonly open some known communication port(s), making themselves targets for denial of service (DoS) attacks. Considering adversaries that can eavesdrop and launch directed DoS attacks to the applications' open ports, solutions based on pseudorandom port-hopping have been suggested [1], [5], where applications defend the attacks to the communication ports by changing them periodically. As port-hopping needs the communicating parties to ""hop"" in a synchronized manner, these solutions suggest acknowledgment-based protocols between a client-server pair or assume the presence of synchronized clocks. Acknowledgments, if lost, can cause a port to be open for longer time and thus be vulnerable to DoS attacks, time servers for synchronizing clocks can become targets to DoS attack themselves. Following this line of research, in [2] we proposed a solution for port-hopping in the presence of clock-drifts, which are common in networking. The solution basically consists of two algorithms: H O P ER AA and B IG W HEEL. H O P ER AA enables each client to interact with the server independently of the other clients, B IG W HEEL enables a server to communicate with multiple clients in a port-hopping manner, without synchronizing with each client individually, which supports multi-party applications as well. Anti-DDoS solutions in the application-level, such as port-hopping, are ineffective when the DDoS attacks aim to congest the victim's network. Victims may need the help from network-based (i.e. in the router level) solutions to solve the problem. Among the network-based solutions against DDoS attacks, network-capability mechanism is a novel approach [6]. A capability is a ticket-like token, checkable by routers, that a server can issue for legitimate traffic. Still, malicious hosts may swamp a server with requests for capability establishment, essentially causing possible Denial-of-Capability (DoC). In [4] we proposed an algorithm to mitigate DoC attacks. With this algorithm, the legitimate hosts can get service with guaranteed probability. The algorithm divides the server's capacity for handling capability requests into quotas. Quotas are allocated based on a sink tree architecture. Randomization and Bloom filters are used as tools against threats (attacking scenarios). Issues on fault-tolerance and the deployment of the approach proposed were also addressed in [4]. The algorithm is not only suitable for solving DoC problem, but also suitable for general authentication-based solution against DDoS attacks, since legitimate hosts always need to get the secret for generating authentication tokens before sending data packets to the server. Mitigating DDoS attacks are challenging not only for the targets of the attacks, but also for the network, as large volume of illegitimate traffic share the same network resources as legitimate traffic and can furthermore causes congestion phenomena and performance degradation. Considering malicious traffic, we would like ideally to disallow it completely from consuming network resources. To achieve that, the malicious traffic should be controlled as close to the source(s) as possible. It is observed that there is a trade-off between the protection level of the network and the efficiency/overhead of the protecting method. By building on earlier work and improving on distribution of control aspects, in [3] we proposed a proactive method, called CluB, to mitigate DDoS attacks. The method balances the effectiveness-overhead trade-off by addressing the issue of granularity of control in the network. CluB can collaborate with different routing policies in the network, including contemporary data gram options. In [3] we estimated the effectiveness of the method and also studied a set of factors for tuning the granularity of control. © 2011 IEEE.",10.1109/EC2ND.2011.18,2-s2.0-84872258739,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84872258739&origin=inward,,1.0,Mitigating distributed denial-of-service attacks: Application-defense and network-defense methods,2012

"Currently, there is no effective defense against large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. While numerous DDoS defense systems exist that offer excellent protection from specific attack types and scenarios, they can frequently be defeated by an attacker aware of their weaknesses. A necessary requirement for successful DDoS defense is wide deployment, but none of these systems can guarantee wide deployment simply because deployment depends more on market and social aspects than on the technical performance of the system. To successfully handle the DDoS threat we must abandon the current paradigm - the design of defense systems that operate in isolation - and shift toward a new paradigm, a distributed framework of heterogeneous systems that cooperate to achieve an effective defense. Heterogeneity is dictated by two major factors. First, the necessary requirements for a successful defense are detection, response and traffic differentiation. These requirements must be met at disjoint points in the Internet and require a disjoint set of functionalities from the defense systems. Second, heterogeneity is dictated by the current state of the DDoS defense field in which numerous systems exist that can offer similar performance and compete for market share. In this paper we show how the paradigm shift can be accomplished quickly and painlessly through the design of DefCOM, a distributed framework that enables the exchange of information and services between existing defense nodes. © 2004 ACM.",,2-s2.0-17644427757,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=17644427757&origin=inward,,31.0,Alliance formation for DDoS defense,2004

"© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.Coordinated intrusion, like DDoS, Worm outbreak and Botnet, is a major threat to network security nowadays and will continue to be a threat in the future. To ensure the Internet security, effective detection and mitigation for such attacks are indispensable. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative intrusion prevention architecture, i.e. CIPA, aiming at confronting such coordinated intrusion behavior. CIPA is deployed as a virtual network of an artificial neural net over the substrate of networks. Taking advantage of the parallel and simple mathematical manipulation of neurons in a neural net, CIPA can disperse its lightweight computation power to the programmable switches of the substrate. Each programmable switch virtualizes one to several neurons. The whole neural net functions like an integrated IDS/IPS. This allows CIPA to detect distributed attacks on a global view. Meanwhile, it does not require high communication and computation overhead. It is scalable and robust. To validate CIPA, we have realized a prototype on Software-Defined Networks. We also conducted simulations and experiments. The results demonstrate that CIPA is effective.",10.1016/j.cose.2015.11.008,2-s2.0-84951282807,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84951282807&origin=inward,,15.0,CIPA: A collaborative intrusion prevention architecture for programmable network and SDN,2016
"There is a growing interest in discovery of internet topology at the interface level. A new generation of highly distributed measurement systems is currently being deployed. Unfortunately, the research community has not examined the problem of how to perform such measurements efficiently and in a network-friendly manner. In this paper we make two contributions toward that end. First, we show that standard topology discovery methods (e.g., skitter) are quite inefficient, repeatedly probing the same interfaces. This is a concern, because when scaled up, such methods will generate so much traffic that they will begin to resemble DDoS attacks. We measure two kinds of redundancy in probing (intra- and inter-monitor) and show that both kinds are important. We show that straightforward approaches to addressing these two kinds of redundancy must take opposite tacks, and are thus fundamentally in conflict. Our second contribution is to propose and evaluate Doubletree, an algorithm that reduces both types of redundancy simultaneously on routers and end systems. The key ideas are to exploit the tree-like structure of routes to and from a single point in order to guide when to stop probing, and to probe each path by starting near its midpoint. Our results show that Doubletree can reduce both types of measurement load on the network dramatically, while permitting discovery of nearly the same set of nodes and links.

"Malicious attacks are frequently launched to make specified network service unavailable, compromising end hosts for political or business purpose. Though network security appliances are widely deployed to resist these attacks, there is a lack of dynamic and collaborative platform to flexibly configure and manage all the security elements. In this paper, we present NetSecu, a platform based on Java and Click Router, which can dynamically enable, disable and configure security elements such as firewall, IPS and AV. Furthermore, a collaborate module is implemented to integrate individual NetSecu platform into a Secure Overlay Network, providing collaborative traffic control against DDoS attack. Equipped with collaborate module, NetSecu platforms are organized in a tree hierarchy where each level node is registered to its father node. A Central Management Site acts as the root node for large scale deployment. The policy is distributed from higher level to lower level NetSecu nodes, while security events are aggregated from lower level to higher level. Performance evaluation shows that our NetSecu system can achieve line rate with and without security function. Finally we deploy the NetSecu platform in multiple sites, where our design is fully demonstrated and tested. © 2011 IEEE.",10.1109/CMC.2011.94,2-s2.0-79960807470,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79960807470&origin=inward,,13.0,NetSecu: A collaborative network security platform for in-network security,2011
"© 2018 IEEE.5G mobile edge computing (MEC), which pushes mobile services to the edge, has been recognized as an effective solution to enhance mobile users' quality of service, as well as to tackle the backhaul bottleneck. Although its architecture and service related techniques have drawn sufficient attentions, solutions to the security defense are still open. Therefore, we are motivated to propose a cooperative defense (CODE) framework against DDoS attacks for MEC by leveraging network function virtualization and software-defined networking architectures; in the framework, MEC nodes owning spare defense resource are orchestrated to help MEC nodes whose incoming traffic overwhelms their self-defense capability. To explore the elasticity space of CODE among multiple MEC nodes and develop an online resource management method of such CODE, we formulate the multi-requester multi-provider resource management problem for CODE, jointly considering the defense resource usage efficiency and the fairness of CODE participants. To balance complexity and performance for the formulated problem, we are motivated by online combinatorial auctions, and propose an online algorithm that has a provable performance guarantee.

"In this paper, it is advocated that defenders should take active action to stop DDoS attacks. We propose a new model based on Differential Games theory. Four main actors are included, Attacker, Defender, Victim, and Botnet. It is our belief that Victims who experience an attack should cooperate with Defender to defend for a DDoS-attack. The model indicates the minimum number of Bots that should blocked by Defender. A Differential Games model is used to determine how a Defender combats an Attacker and protect the servers. The feasibility and effectiveness of our approach is validated by measuring the performance of an experimental prototype against a series of attacks.

© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.Trustworthiness of edge routers and clients plays a significant role in a cloud environment for ensuring reliable packet delivery. Trust of clients depends on the level of cooperation attributed by them for ensuring seamless service and on the support rendered by them for the sake of their neighbouring clients towards the core objective of reliable data dissemination. The level of collaboration between clients is highly influenced by distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks as they directly influence the performance of cloud computing environment by preventing them from involving in normal data transactions that could result in reduced throughput and packet delivery rate. A mean availability parameter-based DDoS detection mechanism (MAPDDM) is contributed for handling the impacts induced by DDoS towards the dynamic clients of the subnet. The performance of MAPDDM is analysed by varying the size of subnets and number of attackers under the dynamic influence of varying traffic request using CloudSim. The simulation results infer that MAPDDM is phenomenal in sustaining the trust value of clients to a maximum of 82% even when the amount of traffic is varied.,10.1007/978-981-10-8663-2_12,2-s2.0-85047471838,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047471838&origin=inward,,2.0,Mean availability parameter-based DDoS detection mechanism for cloud computing environments,2019
"© 2019 IEEE.A DDoS attack is a spiteful attempt to disrupt legitimate traffic to a server by overwhelming the target with a flood of requests from geographically dispersed systems. Today attackers prefer DDoS attack methods to disrupt target services as they generate GBs to TBs of random data to flood the target. In existing mitigation strategies, because of lack of resources and not having the flexibility to cope with attacks by themselves, they are not considered to be that effective. So effective DDoS mitigation techniques can be provided using emerging technologies such as blockchain and SDN(Software-Defined Networking). We propose an architecture where a smart contract is deployed in a private blockchain, which facilitates a collaborative DDoS mitigation architecture across multiple network domains. Blockchain application is used as an additional security service. With Blockchain, shared protection is enabled among all hosts. With help of smart contracts, rules are distributed among all hosts. In addition, SDN can effectively enable services and security policies dynamically. This mechanism provides ASes(Autonomous Systems) the possibility to deploy their own DPS(DDoS Prevention Service) and there is no need to transfer control of the network to the third party. This paper focuses on the challenges of protecting a hybridized enterprise from the ravages of rapidly evolving Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attack.",10.1109/I-SMAC47947.2019.9032690,2-s2.0-85083039355,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85083039355&origin=inward,,0.0,Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) Mitigation in Software Defined Network using Blockchain,2019
"© 2017 IEEE.High-profile and often destructive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks continue to be one of the top security concerns as the DDoS attacks volumes are increasing constantly. Among them, the SYN Flood attack is the most common type. Conventional DDoS defense solutions may not be preferable, since they demand highly capable hardware resources, which induce high cost and long deployment cycle. The emerging of network function virtualization (NFV) technology introduces new opportunities to decrease the amount of proprietary hardware that is needed to launch and operate network services. In this paper, we propose a DDoS defense mechanism named CoFence, which facilitates a ""domain-helps-domain"" collaboration network among NFV-based domain networks. CoFence allows domain networks to help each other in handling large volume of DDoS attacks through resource sharing. Specifically, we design a dynamic resource allocation mechanism for domains so that the resource allocation is fair, efficient, and incentive-compatible. The resource sharing mechanism is modeled as a multi-leader-follower Stackelberg game. In this game, all domains have a degree of control to maximize their own utility. The resource supplier domains determine the amount of resource to each requesting peer based on optimizing a reciprocal-based utility function. On the other hand, the resource requesting domains decide the level of demand to send to the resource supplier domains in order to reach sufficient support. Our simulation results demonstrate that the designed resource allocation game is effective, incentive compatible, fair, and reciprocal under its Nash equilibrium.",10.1109/TIFS.2017.2708693,2-s2.0-85029210559,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85029210559&origin=inward,,17.0,A Collaborative DDoS Defence Framework Using Network Function Virtualization,2017
"Attacks on the networks are most important issues. Therefore, the prevention of such attacks is imperative. The hindrance of such attacks is exclusively dependent on their detection. The detection is a prime part of any security tool such as Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Adaptive Security Alliance (ASA), check points and firewalls. A variety of intrusion detection approaches be present to resolve this severe issue but the main problem is performance. Therefore, in this paper, a model is proposed to overcome performance issues. In this model, support vector machine (SVM) and backpropagation neural network are applied on distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks. The system uses sampled data form cooperative association for internet data analysis (CAIDA) dataset, an attack database that is a standard for evaluating the security detection mechanisms.

"This paper presents a new spectral template-matching approach to countering shrew distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks are stealthy, periodic, pulsing, and low-rate in attack volume, very different from the flooding type of attacks. They are launched with high narrow spikes in very low frequency, periodically. Thus, shrew attacks may endanger the victim systems for a long time without being detected. In other words, such attacks may reduce the quality of services unnoticeably. Our defense method calls for collaborative detection and filtering (CDF) of shrew DDoS attacks. We detect shrew attack flows hidden in legitimate TCP/UDP streams by spectral analysis against pre-stored template of average attack spectral characteristics. This novel scheme is suitable for either software or hardware implementation. The CDF scheme is implemented with the NS-2 network simulator using real-life Internet background traffic mixed with attack datasets used by established research groups. Our simulated results show high detection accuracy by merging alerts from cooperative routers. Both theoretical modeling and simulation experimental results are reported here. The experiments achieved up to 95% successful detection of network anomalies along with a low 10% false positive alarms. The scheme cuts off malicious flows containing shrew attacks using a newly developed packet-filtering scheme. Our filtering scheme retained 99% of legitimate TCP flows, compared with only 20% TCP flows retained by using the Drop Tail algorithm.

The Monitors conduct anomaly detection and the Correlators perform deep packet inspection for attack signature recognition. These elements take advantage of complementary views and information availability on both the data and control planes. Moreover, they collaboratively look for network flooding attack signature constituents that possess different characteristics in the level of information abstraction. Therefore, this approach is able to not only quickly raise an alert against potential threats, but also follow it up with careful verification to reduce false alarms.

"Traditional Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) focus on low-level attacks or anomalies, and they raise alerts independently, though there may be logical connections between them. With the development of network security infrastructure and technology, it seems that attackers continuously adjust and upgrade their intrusion methods to escape from security inspection. Some kinds of intricate intrusion mode are widely used now. When meeting with these intricate intrusions such as Distributed denial of service (DDoS), network administrator may find alerts with unmanageable amount and true alerts mixed with false alerts. As a result, it is difficult for intrusion response systems and users to understand the alerts and take appropriate actions. This is why alert correlation technology has developed with such a striking speed in recent years. As is motivated by the urgent requirement to process alerts efficiently and correctly, in this paper we present a logical causality analysis method to apply correlation operation to the alerts generated in cooperative intrusion detection framework, in which we try to discover the implicit logical causality between alerts and make use of the causality to combine the alerts with logical causality and generate higher - level alerts. To verify the performance of the alert correlation operation in practice, we also give an implementation of the system prototype and illustrate the experiment results, from which we can find out that the alert correlation operation can achieve a good compromising point between the efficiency and correctness of the correlation process.",,2-s2.0-34547209651,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=34547209651&origin=inward,,0.0,Logical causality analysis method for alert correlation,2007

Traditionally IP-Based Filtering has been used to combat these attacks, however studies shows that thousands of distributed zombies work in cooperation generate huge network traffic that result in distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks and illegitimate access to resources and services. In this paper, first we studied attacks and mitigation scenarios to analyze network wide DDoS security anomalies. This will help us to drive supplementary active measurements to characterize the strength and characteristic of attacks to improve correlation of our log data and with other publicly available network traffic analysis data. Secondly, we presented a monitoring scheme to simulate a variety of attacks on different mobile operating system.

"Testing security systems is challenging because a system's authors have to play the double role of attackers and defenders. Red Team/Blue Team exercises are an invaluable mechanism for security testing. They partition researchers into two competing teams of attackers and defenders, enabling them to create challenging and realistic test scenarios. While such exercises provide valuable insight into vulnerabilities of security systems, they are very expensive and thus rarely performed. In this paper we describe a Red Team/Blue Team exercise, sponsored by DARPA's FTN program, and performed October 2002 to May 2003. The goal of the exercise was to evaluate a collaborative DDoS defense, comprised of a distributed system, COSSACK, and a stand-alone defense, D-WARD. The role of the Blue Team was played by developers of the tested systems from USC/ISI and UCLA, the Red Team included researchers from Sandia National Laboratory, and all the coordination, experiment execution, result collection and analysis was performed by the White Team from BBN Technologies. This exercise was of immense value to all involved - it uncovered significant vulnerabilities in tested systems, pointed out desirable characteristics in DDoS defense systems (e.g., avoiding reliance on timing mechanisms), and taught us many lessons about testing of DDoS defenses. © 2008 IEEE.",10.1109/TC.2008.42,2-s2.0-47049083714,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=47049083714&origin=inward,,20.0,Testing a collaborative DDoS defense in a red team/blue team exercise,2008
"This paper presents a new distributed approach to detecting DDoS (distributed denial of services) flooding attacks at the traffic flow level. The new defense system is suitable for efficient implementation over the core networks operated by Internet service providers (ISP). At the early stage of a DDoS attack, some traffic fluctuations are detectable at Internet routers or at gateways of edge networks. We develop a distributed change-point detection (DCD) architecture using change aggregation trees (CAT). The idea is to detect abrupt traffic changes across multiple network domains at the earliest time. Early detection of DDoS attacks minimizes the flooding damages to the victim systems serviced by the provider.The system is built over attack-transit routers, which work together cooperatively. Each ISP domain has a CAT server to aggregate the flooding alerts reported by the routers. CAT domain servers collaborate among themselves to make the final decision. To resolve policy conflicts at different ISP domains, a new secure infrastructure protocol (SIP) is developed to establish the mutual trust or consensus. We simulated the DCD system up to 16 network domains on the DETER testbed, a 220-node PC cluster for Internet emulation experiments at USC Information Science Institute. Experimental results show that 4 network domains are sufficient to yield a 98 percent detection accuracy with only 1percent false-postive alarms. Based on a 2006 Internet report on AS (autonomous system) domain distribution, we prove that this DDoS defense systrem can scale well to cover 84 AS domains. This security coverage is wide enough to safeguard most ISP core networks from real-life DDoS flooding attacks. © 2007 IEEE.",10.1109/TPDS.2007.1111,2-s2.0-36348929372,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=36348929372&origin=inward,,163.0,Collaborative detection of DDoS attacks over multiple network domains,2007

"Spoofing source IP addresses is always utilized to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Most of current detection and prevention methods against DDoS ignore the innocent side, whose IP is utilized as the spoofed IP by the attacker. In this paper, a novel method has been proposed to against the direct DDoS attacks, which consists of two components: the client detector and the server detector. The cooperation of those two components and their interactive behavior lead to an early stage detection of a DDoS attack.

"© 2016 IEEE.In this paper, we investigate collaborative schemes to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service attacks in multi-domain Software Defined Networks (SDNs). The mitigation process itself is distributed, initiated by the domain of the victim, and involving all domains in the path of an attack (transit domains). We emphasize on filtering malicious flows as close to the attack sources as possible. We propose a modular and scalable approach that leverages on the SDNi (SDN interface) protocol, as the enabler for information exchange between adjacent SDN domains. We extend this protocol by publishing and exchanging pointers to incident reports, formatted according to the IETF IODEF standards and exposed through domain SDN Controllers. Thus, an SDN domain hosting the victim of the attack is able to notify the recipients about the malicious flows that they forward, requesting their filtering until the attack ceases. In order to motivate close cooperation of SDN domains governed by diverse authorities, we implemented and evaluated a reputation mechanism, whereby domains historically assess the behavior of their neighbors, discouraging assistance in case the domain of the victim has a poor cooperation track record.",10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502849,2-s2.0-84979776717,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84979776717&origin=inward,,7.0,A reputation-based collaborative schema for the mitigation of distributed attacks in SDN domains,2016
"At present, researchers have already proposed many methods for tracing DoS or DDoS attack, but few attention is put on DRDoS (Distributed Reflector Denial of Service) traceback. In DRDoS, the slaves hide behind the innocent reflectors, which makes the general DoS or DDoS traceback methods be hard to apply to DRDoS traceback. In this paper, we propose a collaborative traceback method-ADPM (Authenticated Deterministic Packet Marking) to trace DRDoS attack. In ADPM, routers mark request packets, log request packets' mark information and add corresponding logging to response packets, so victims can locate slaves when suffered DRDoS attack. Analysis and simulation results show that ADPM has the following advantages: requires small memory to logs the mark information; be able to resist forging mark information; can be deployed conveniently and incrementally; both the false positive and the number of packets needed for path reconstruction are small. © 2011 Binary Information Press.",,2-s2.0-79955088914,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79955088914&origin=inward,,4.0,Traceback DRDoS attacks,2011
"Owing to the distributed nature of denial-of-service attacks, it is tremendously challenging to detect such malicious behavior using traditional intrusion detection systems in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In the current paper, a game theoretic method is introduced, namely cooperative Game-based Fuzzy Q-learning (G-FQL). G-FQL adopts a combination of both the game theoretic approach and the fuzzy Q-learning algorithm in WSNs. It is a three-player strategy game consisting of sink nodes, a base station, and an attacker. The game performs at any time a victim node in the network receives a flooding packet as a DDoS attack beyond a specific alarm event threshold in WSN. The proposed model implements cooperative defense counter-attack scenarios for the sink node and the base station to operate as rational decision-maker players through a game theory strategy. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) was simulated using NS-2 simulator. The model is subsequently compared against other existing soft computing methods, such as fuzzy logic controller, Q-learning, and fuzzy Q-learning, in terms of detection accuracy, counter-defense, network lifetime and energy consumption, to demonstrate its efficiency and viability. The proposed models attack detection and defense accuracy yield a greater improvement than existing above-mentioned machine learning methods. In contrast to the Markovian game theoretic, the proposed model operates better in terms of successful defense rate. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.engappai.2014.02.001,2-s2.0-84900419562,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84900419562&origin=inward,,92.0,Cooperative game theoretic approach using fuzzy Q-learning for detecting and preventing intrusions in wireless sensor networks,2014
"The growth in coordinated network attacks such as scans, worms and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks is a profound threat to the security of the Internet. Collaborative intrusion detection systems (CIDSs) have the potential to detect these attacks, by enabling all the participating intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to share suspicious intelligence with each other to form a global view of the current security threats. Current correlation algorithms in CIDSs are either too simple to capture the important characteristics of attacks, or too computationally expensive to detect attacks in a timely manner. We propose a decentralized, multi-dimensional alert correlation algorithm for CIDSs to address these challenges. A multi-dimensional alert clustering algorithm is used to extract the significant intrusion patterns from raw intrusion alerts. A two-stage correlation algorithm is used, which first clusters alerts locally at each IDS, before reporting significant alert patterns to a global correlation stage. We introduce a probabilistic approach to decide when a pattern at the local stage is sufficiently significant to warrant correlation at the global stage. We then implement the proposed two-stage correlation algorithm in a fully distributed CIDS. Our experiments on a large real-world intrusion data set show that our approach can achieve a significant reduction in the number of alert messages generated by the local correlation stage with negligible false negatives compared to a centralized scheme. The proposed probabilistic threshold approach gains a significant improvement in detection accuracy in a stealthy attack scenario, compared to a naive scheme that uses the same threshold at the local and global stages. A large scale experiment on PlanetLab shows that our decentralized architecture is significantly more efficient than a centralized approach in terms of the time required to correlate alerts.

"Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet have become an immediate problem. As DDoS streams do not have common characteristics, currently available intrusion detection systems (IDS) can not detect them accurately. As a result, defend DDoS attacks based on current available IDS will dramatically affect legitimate traffic. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach to defend against distributed denial of service attacks by coordinating across the Internet. Unlike traditional IDS, we detect and stop DDoS attacks within the intermediate network. In the proposed approach, DDoS defense systems are deployed in the network to detect DDoS attacks independently. A gossip based communication mechanism is used to exchange information about network attacks between these independent detection nodes to aggregate information about the overall network attacks observed. Using the aggregated information, the individual defense nodes have approximate information about global network attacks and can stop them more effectively and accurately. To provide reliable, rapid and widespread dissemination of attack information, the system is built as a peer to peer overlay network on top of the internet.",,2-s2.0-78651059765,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78651059765&origin=inward,,2.0,Cooperative defense against network attacks,2005

"Adaptive techniques based on machine learning and data mining are gaining relevance in self-management and self-defense for networks and distributed systems. In this paper, we focus on early detection and stopping of distributed flooding attacks and network abuses. We extend the framework proposed by Zhang and Parashar (2006) to cooperatively detect and react to abnormal behaviors before the target machine collapses and network performance degrades. In this framework, nodes in an intermediate network share information about their local traffc observations, improving their global traffc perspective. In our proposal, we add to each node the ability of learning independently, therefore reacting dierently according to its situation in the network and local traffc conditions. In particular, this frees the administrator from having to guess and manually set the parameters distinguishing attacks from non-attacks: now such thresholds are learned and set from experience or past data. We expect that our framework provides a faster detection and more accuracy in front of distributed flooding attacks than if staticlters or single-machine adaptive mechanisms areused. We show simulations where indeed we observe a high rate of stopped attacks with minimum disturbance to the legitimate users.

"The security vulnerabilities in a network environment and their corresponding countermeasures have become more critical issues than ever. Although many researchers and vendors have introduced powerful mechanisms such as Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) for network security, the packet-based decision is not always correct, especially when those systems are involved in network traffics across multiple organizations under different security policies. In fact, some legitimate (normal) network traffics produce a similar pattern to that of malicious traffics such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), and vice versa. We call those traffics suspicious. Suspicious traffic cannot be clearly designated as malicious or normal traffic. Since traditional IDS or IPS approaches make a simple binary decision (i.e., allow or reject) based on pre-defmed rules, there is a high possibility that suspicious/legitimate packets are rejected or suspicious/malicious packets are allowed. To enhance the quality of service in a network environment, we propose in this paper a Packet Marking-Based Cooperative Attack Response Service (pm-CARS) that is able to effectively deal with suspicious network traffic. pm-CARS nodes cooperate with each other by using packet-marking. These pm-CARS nodes mark suspicious packets instead of dropping them. All the marked packets are forwarded to the next node using a low priority of service designation, which indicates the drop probability is very high. Our pm-CARS includes two schemes: abnormal IP address detection and abnormal excess traffic detection schemes. Our pm-CARS can reduce the false-positive rate and can protect the quality of service for innocent traffic from attacks. Finally, we simulate our ideas in a network environment and discuss the evaluation results. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,2-s2.0-33845922670,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=33845922670&origin=inward,,3.0,Packet marking based cooperative attack response service for effectively handling suspicious traffic,2006
"© 1986-2012 IEEE.Distributed denial of service is one of the most critical threats to the availability of Internet services.

However, the mobility of user equipment and the distinctive characteristics of traffic behavior in mobile networks also limit the detection capabilities of traditional anti-DDoS techniques. In this article, we present a novel collaborative DDoS defense architecture called MECPASS to mitigate the attack traffic from mobile devices. Our design involves two filtering hierarchies. First, filters at edge computing servers (i.e., local nodes) seek to prevent spoofing attacks and anomalous traffic near sources as much as possible. Second, global analyzers located at cloud servers (i.e., central nodes) classify the traffic of the entire monitored network and unveil suspicious behaviors by periodically aggregating data from the local nodes. We have explored the effectiveness of our system on various types of application- layer DDoS attacks in the context of web servers.

"© 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service, a network, or even an entire organization, unavailable by saturating it with traffic from multiple sources. DDoS attacks are among the most common and most devastating threats that network defenders have to watch out for. DDoS attacks are becoming bigger, more frequent, and more sophisticated. Volumetric attacks are the most common types of DDoS attacks. A DDoS attack is considered volumetric, or high-rate, when within a short period of time it generates a large amount of packets or a high volume of traffic. High-rate attacks are well-known and have received much attention in the past decade; however, despite several detection and mitigation strategies have been designed and implemented, high-rate attacks are still halting the normal operation of information technology infrastructures across the Internet when the protection mechanisms are not able to cope with the aggregated capacity that the perpetrators have put together.

"Increasing use of the Internet for critical services makes flooding distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) a top security threat.

Three main DDoS defense functionalities -attack detection, rate limiting and traffic differentiation -are most effective when performed at the victim-end, core and sourceend respectively. Many existing systems are successful in one aspect of defense, but none offers a comprehensive solution and none has seen a wide deployment. We propose to harvest the strengths of existing defenses by organizing them into a collaborative overlay, called DefCOM, and augmenting them with communication and collaboration functionalities.

Both, the actions to increase the resilience and the prevention of signature based detection are counteractions against detection techniques.

Hence, the goal of this PhD research is to enable early detection of the deployment and operation of botnets to facilitate proactive mitigation strategies, whereas current approaches usually detect botnets while these are already in active use. Consequently, this proactive approach prevents botnets to fully evolve their size and attack power. Moreover, as many end users are unable to detect and clean infected machines, our approach tackles the botnet phenomenon without requiring any end user involvement, by incorporating ISPs and domain name registrars. In addition, this will enable the discovery of similar behaviour of different connected systems, which allows detection in cases where bots are registered under domains that are not willing to cooperate.",10.1007/978-3-319-39814-3_15,2-s2.0-84976631558,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84976631558&origin=inward,,1.0,How to achieve early botnet detection at the provider level?,2016
"DDoS attacks constitute one of the major intimidating hardest security problems facing today's Internet. The goal is to flood the victim with overwhelming amounts of traffic, with the purpose of preventing legitimate users from using a victim computing system or network resources. Irrespective of the security features incorporated in the victim system, the acceptable level of security depends on the state of security in the rest of the global Internet. To enhance the overall security against DDoS attack, a cooperative defense mechanism will be the constructive solution. This paper proposes one such effective cooperative multilayer defense mechanism. Unlike other existing systems, our system is capable of handling various forms of DoS attacks. Providing mitigation either at source end or at victim end may not be a complete solution in contrast, our multilayer mitigation is active at both ends. The spoofing and high rate flooding attacks are limited at the source end by implementing comprehensive approach at the network layer and low rate flooding attack at the victim end by implementing Similarity based mechanism at the application layer simultaneously. The performance of the multilayer defense mechanism is validated through extensive simulation in NS-2. The real data sets are used for our analysis and the experimental results show that our scheme can efficiently detect DDoS.",,2-s2.0-84896943216,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84896943216&origin=inward,,0.0,A cooperative multilayer end-point approach to mitigate DDoS attack,2014
"In this paper, we extend our previous study on VPOE (Virtual Private Operation Environment) to provide the DDOS (distributed deny of service) prevention service in a distributed heterogeneous environment. We introduce our integrated middleware-based defense system to support this service with studying two important components-middleware box and domain agent. Our technology includes the following: (1) We adopt network-based middlewares. The network-based middleware is realized by special devices inserted in various locations of the network. Middlewares in the system cooperate to achieve the defense mission objectives. (2) We take the generic primitive and role-based approaches. With the network primitives, middlewares are programmable entities and can change their roles during the system run-time according to the system defense requirements. (3) We take the generic signaling strategy. With the generic signaling control protocols, middlewares can cooperate with each other effectively to achieve the high defense performance globally. There are several advantages with our approach: (-1) Middlewares provide transparent services to applications and make our solution both upward and downward compatible. Thus, our technology can be easily deployed with the current computing and communication infrastructure. (2) Our solution is highly efficient. By using the generic middleware box control protocols and network primitives, the middleware boxes can cooperatively share the countenneasure information and easily change their roles run-time to efficiently prevent DDOS attack. In this sense, our defense system can adoptively deploy the defense strategy according to the dynamic network attack situation. As a result, our technology is effective and can be used in a large system.",,2-s2.0-0036999094,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=0036999094&origin=inward,,2.0,Middleware-based approach for preventing distributed deny of service attacks,2002

"A community network often operates with the same Internet Service Provider domain or the virtual network of different entities who are cooperating with each other. In such a federated network environment, routers can work closely to raise early warning of DDoS attacks to void catastrophic damages. However, the attackers simulate the normal network behaviors, e.g. pumping the attack packages as Poisson distribution, to disable detection algorithms. It is an open question: how to discriminate DDoS attacks from surge legitimate accessing. We noticed that the attackers use the same mathematical functions to control the speed of attack package pumping to the victim. Based on this observation, the different attack flows of a DDoS attack share the same regularities, which is different from the real surging accessing in a short time period. We apply information theory parameter, entropy rate, to discriminate the DDoS attack from the surge legitimate accessing.

"Recently, sensor networks are usually applied on collecting remote sensing information. The deployed sensor nodes are separated and responsible for specific purposes, and act as an individual device. They cooperatively transmit sensed data to the base station, as shown in Fig. 1. However, the transmitted data are exposed to open environments, and possibly contain confidential information. If malicious attacks interfere in the communication using huge packets to break the communication, thus the system can not work properly. In general, attackers exploit a broadcast storm or a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack to paralyze the entire network. Therefore, this study proposes a queuing theory based scheme to detect whether the system encounters malicious attacks. Our proposed scheme provides the arrival requests with a queuing service on the base station, which is responsible for dealing with transmitted jobs. Once the jammed traffic is anomalous for long periods, the system immediately detects the malicious attacks using our proposed approach. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.",10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.121-122.58,2-s2.0-78650728197,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78650728197&origin=inward,,4.0,Intrusion detection mechanisms based on queuing theory in remote distribution sensor networks,2010
"© 2013 IEEE.The future smart grids (SGs) require advanced capabilities in terms of automation, processing, monitoring, and communication. The most crucial component in the successful sustainability of SGs is communication management. In the vSDNs, a hypervisor is implemented between a physical infrastructure and a control plane that abstracts the underlying SDN infrastructure into multiple isolated virtual slices, i.e., we can have multiple vSDNs each with its controller. For that purpose, the virtualized SDNs offer a promising solution as they offer better network management, programmability, and virtualization. However, vSDN-based SGs are prone to many security issues. To disturb operations of the SGs, the security of the vSDN can be compromised by manipulating the jeopardized switches in the DDoS attacks to repress the resources of vSDN controllers. To prevent the exploitation of a vSDN-based SG architecture and preserve its limited resources, this paper formulates the strategic interaction between a hypervisor monitoring its vSDN controllers and the source of new flow requests potentially launching a DDoS attack, via compromised switches, as a non-cooperative dynamic Bayesian game of intrusion detection. Our game model enables a hypervisor to distribute its limited resources to monitor guest vSDN controllers optimally. The performance evaluation via simulations shows that our game model enables a hypervisor not only to increase the probability of detecting distributed attacks and minimize false positives but at the same time, its monitoring costs get reduced as the allocation of resources to monitor vSDN controllers depends upon its belief about the source of the attacks that it forms based on its observation.",10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2924968,2-s2.0-85069797917,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85069797917&origin=inward,,0.0,A Bayesian Game-Theoretic Intrusion Detection System for Hypervisor-Based Software Defined Networks in Smart Grids,2019

The detection of this attacks even though challenging, it is required to secure not only the end users but also expensive network infrastructure resources. The Base of the system is combination of Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs) situated at the Network level. The success in detecting and respond to DDoS attacks is highly dependent on the data monitored by the employed traffic monitoring mechanisms, the degree of collaboration among various domains, and the response approach employed in various domains.

This system is able to minimize the possibility of initial intrusion and damages of the system by promptly responding through rapid detection of an attack when the target system is attacked.

"Internet security problems remain a major challenge with many security concerns such as Internet worms, spam, and phishing attacks. Botnets, well-organized distributed network attacks, consist of a large number of bots that generate huge volumes of spam or launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on victim hosts. New emerging botnet attacks degrade the status of Internet security further. To address these problems, a practical collaborative network security management system is proposed with an effective collaborative Unified Threat Management (UTM) and traffic probers. A distributed security overlay network with a centralized security center leverages a peer-to-peer communication protocol used in the UTMs collaborative module and connects them virtually to exchange network events and security rules. Security functions for the UTM are retrofitted to share security rules. In this paper, we propose a design and implementation of a cloud-based security center for network security forensic analysis. We propose using cloud storage to keep collected traffic data and then processing it with cloud computing platforms to find the malicious attacks. As a practical example, phishing attack forensic analysis is presented and the required computing and storage resources are evaluated based on real trace data. The cloud-based security center can instruct each collaborative UTM and prober to collect events and raw traffic, send them back for deep analysis, and generate new security rules. These new security rules are enforced by collaborative UTM and the feedback events of such rules are returned to the security center. By this type of close-loop control, the collaborative network security management system can identify and address new distributed attacks more quickly and effectively. © 1996-2012 Tsinghua University Press.",10.1109/TST.2013.6449406,2-s2.0-84876261368,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84876261368&origin=inward,,44.0,Cloud computing-based forensic analysis for collaborative network security management system,2013

In other words, our proposed framework ensures a trusted, reliable communication between vehicles and delivering reduced network overhead by handling the DDoS attacks. T-DARF is built of three elements: (1) for the detection of dishonest nodes it includes a collaborative and distributed elements, (2) to filter the malicious data it includes a data-centric validation element, and (3) a delay checking element for the detection and prevention against DoS and DDoS attacks.

"© 2016 The Authors.Cloud computing provides a framework for supporting end users easily attaching powerful services and applications through Internet. To give secure and reliable services in cloud computing environment is an important issue. Providing security requires more than user authentication with passwords or digital certificates and confidentiality in data transmission, because it is vulnerable and prone to network intrusions that affect confidentiality, availability and integrity of Cloud resources and offered services. To detect DoS attack and other network level malicious activities in Cloud, use of only traditional firewall is not an efficient solution. In this paper, we propose a cooperative and hybrid network intrusion detection system (CH-NIDS) to detect network attacks in the Cloud environment by monitoring network traffic, while maintaining performance and service quality. In our NIDS framework, we use Snort as a signature based detection to detect known attacks, while for detecting network anomaly, we use Back-Propagation Neural network (BPN). By applying snort prior to the BPN classifier, BPN has to detect only unknown attacks. So, detection time is reduced. To solve the problem of slow convergence of BPN and being easy to fall into local optimum, we propose to optimize the parameters of it by using an optimization algorithm in order to ensure high detection rate, high accuracy, low false positives and low false negatives with affordable computational cost. In addition, in this framework, the IDSs operate in cooperative way to oppose the DoS and DDoS attacks by sharing alerts stored in central log. In this way, unknown attacks that were detected by any IDS can easily be detected by others IDSs. This also helps to reduce computational cost for detecting intrusions at others IDS, and improve detection rate in overall the Cloud environment.",10.1016/j.procs.2016.04.249,2-s2.0-84971234009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84971234009&origin=inward,,21.0,A Cooperative and Hybrid Network Intrusion Detection Framework in Cloud Computing Based on Snort and Optimized Back Propagation Neural Network,2016
"© 2017 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Conservation of biological communities requires accurate estimates of abundance for multiple species. Recent advances in estimating abundance of multiple species, such as Bayesian multispecies N-mixture models, account for multiple sources of variation, including detection error. However, false-positive errors (misidentification or double counts), which are prevalent in multispecies data sets, remain largely unaddressed. The dependent-double observer (DDO) method is an emerging method that both accounts for detection error and is suggested to reduce the occurrence of false positives because it relies on two observers working collaboratively to identify individuals. To date, the DDO method has not been combined with advantages of multispecies N-mixture models. Here, we derive an extension of a multispecies N-mixture model using the DDO survey method to create a multispecies dependent double-observer abundance model (MDAM). The MDAM uses a hierarchical framework to account for biological and observational processes in a statistically consistent framework while using the accurate observation data from the DDO survey method. We demonstrate that the MDAM accurately estimates abundance of multiple species with simulated and real multispecies data sets. Simulations showed that the model provides both precise and accurate abundance estimates, with average credible interval coverage across 100 repeated simulations of 94.5% for abundance estimates and 92.5% for detection estimates. In addition, 92.2% of abundance estimates had a mean absolute percent error between 0% and 20%, with a mean of 7.7%. We present the MDAM as an important step forward in expanding the applicability of the DDO method to a multispecies setting. Previous implementation of the DDO method suggests the MDAM can be applied to a broad array of biological communities. We suggest that researchers interested in assessing biological communities consider the MDAM as a tool for deriving accurate, multispecies abundance estimates.",10.1002/ece3.2946,2-s2.0-85017375856,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85017375856&origin=inward,,3.0,A multispecies dependent double-observer model: A new method for estimating multispecies abundance,2017
"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks constitute a rapidly evolving threat in the current Internet. Multiagent Router Throttling is a novel approach to defend against DDoS attacks where multiple reinforcement learning agents are installed on a set of routers and learn to throttle or rate-limit traffic towards a victim server. It has been demonstrated to perform well against DDoS attacks in small-scale network topologies. The focus of this paper is to tackle the scalability challenge. Scalability is one of the most important aspects of a defence system since a non-scalable defence mechanism will never be considered, let alone adopted, for wide deployment by a company or organisation. In this paper we introduce Coordinated Team Learning (CTL) which is a novel design to the original Multiagent Router Throttling approach. One of the novel characteristics of our approach is that it provides a decentralised coordinated response to the DDoS problem. It incorporates several mechanisms, namely, hierarchical team-based communication, task decomposition and team rewards and its scalability is successfully demonstrated in experiments involving up to 100 reinforcement learning agents. We compare our proposed approach against a baseline and a popular state-of-the-art router throttling technique from the network security literature and we show that our approach significantly outperforms both of them in a series of scenarios with increasingly sophisticated attack dynamics.

We assume that Internet is divided into multiple domains and there exists one or more domain security manager in each domain, which is responsible for identifying hosts within the domain. The security management cooperation is achieved in two steps. First, a domain security manager forwards information regarding identified suspicious attack flows to neighboring managers. Secondly, the domain security manager verifies the attack upon receiving return messages from the neighboring managers. The management method proposed in this paper is designed not only to prevent network resources from being exhausted by the attacks but also to increase the possibility that legitimate users can fairly access the target services.

This paper proposes DiDoS (Distributed Defence of Service), a collaborative DDoS defence architecture that leverages victim feedback to build network-level sender reputations that are applied to identify and thwart attack traffic - thus alleviating the need for resource enlargement. Since attack traffic is dropped at points of contention in the Internet, (rather than rote blocking at source) DiDoS reduces the impact of false positives and enables the traversal of legitimate traffic from said devices across the Internet. Through anti-spoofing protection and preferential treatment of DiDoS-compliant devices, DiDoS offers adoption incentives that help offset the Tragedy of the Commons effect of DDoS mitigation, which commonly sees non-victim intermediary entities benefit little from DDoS defence expenditure.

In this paper, we propose an advanced DoS Threat Analytics System (DTAS) to mitigate the full range of DoS network attacks – not just volumetric, based on comprehensive collaborative detection algorithms, implemented in the Elasticsearch Big Data platform. DTAS security solution is driven by powerful threat detection algorithms that: a) dissects all attack probabilities in the network traffic, b) Uses behavioural analytics to correlate multiple parameters and generate multi-vector representations, c) Employs dynamic challenges to verify normal versus attack traffic. The DTAS analytics engine analyses multiple IP attributes within TCP and UDP flows, ICMP, HTTP and DNS traffic, count, frequency, headers, payloads, detecting covert traffic, amplification attacks trying to target the services on the network. By measuring all these attributes, our system creates a multi-vector heuristic representation of the normal or baseline traffic flows. We have used datasets from UCLA, downloaded traces from real world incidents and tested the efficacy of the system with various large-scale simulated DoS attacks in the test network.

"Distributed Denial-of-Service attack (DDoS) is one of the most outstanding menaces on the Internet. A DDoS attack generally attempts to overwhelm the victim in order to deny their services to legitimate users. A number of approaches have been proposed for defending against DDoS attacks accurately in real time. However, existing schemes have limits in terms of detection accuracy and delay if the IDRS (Intrusion Detection and Response System) deployed only at a specific location detects and responds against attacks. As in this case, it is not able to catch the characteristic of the attack which is distributed in large-scale. Moreover, the existing detection schemes have vulnerabilities to intellectual DDoS attacks which are able to avoid its detection threshold or delay its detection time. This paper suggests the effective DDoS defense system which uses the collaborative scheme among distributed IDRSs located in the vicinity of the attack source or victim network. In proposed scheme, both victim and source-end IDRS work synergistically to identify the attack and avoid false alarm rate up to great extent. Additionally, we propose the duplicate detection window scheme to detect various attacks dynamics which increase the detection threshold gradually in early stage. The proposed scheme can effectively detect and respond against these diverse DDoS attack dynamics.

In this paper, an anomaly-based approach using two new information metrics such as the generalized entropy metric and the information distance metric, to detect low-rate DDoS attacks by measuring the difference between legitimate traffic and attack traffic is proposed. DDoS attacks detection metric is combined with IP traceback algorithm to form an effective collaborative defense mechanism against DDoS attacks. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",10.1007/978-1-4614-3363-7_3,2-s2.0-84867065003,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84867065003&origin=inward,,2.0,DDoS attacks defense system using information metrics,2013
"© 2018 IEEE.In this paper, we present Nyx, the first system to both effectively mitigate modern Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks regardless of the amount of traffic under adversarial control and function without outside cooperation or an Internet redesign. Nyx approaches the problem of DDoS mitigation as a routing problem rather than a filtering problem. This conceptual shift allows Nyx to avoid many of the common shortcomings of existing academic and commercial DDoS mitigation systems. By leveraging how Autonomous Systems (ASes) handle route advertisement in the existing Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), Nyx allows the deploying AS to achieve isolation of traffic from a critical upstream AS off of attacked links and onto alternative, uncongested, paths. This isolation removes the need for filtering or de-prioritizing attack traffic. Nyx controls outbound paths through normal BGP path selection, while return paths from critical ASes are controlled through the use of specific techniques we developed using existing traffic engineering principles and require no outside coordination. Using our own realistic Internet-scale simulator, we find that in more than 98% of cases our system can successfully route critical traf?c around network segments under transit-link DDoS attacks; a new form of DDoS attack where the attack traf?c never reaches the victim AS, thus invaliding defensive filtering, throttling, or prioritization strategies. More significantly, in over 95% of those cases, the alternate path provides complete congestion relief from transit-link DDoS. Nyx additionally provides complete congestion relief in over 75% of cases when the deployer is being directly attacked.",10.1109/SP.2018.00032,2-s2.0-85051049050,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051049050&origin=inward,,8.0,Routing Around Congestion: Defeating DDoS Attacks and Adverse Network Conditions via Reactive BGP Routing,2018

Due to openness, decentralized, self organizing nature of MANET, it is vulnerable to various attacks. So security is the main concern in MANET.

"© 2019 Academy and Industry Research Collaboration Center (AIRCC).Today vehicles are connected to private networks which are owned by the car manufacturer. But in coming years, vehicles become more and more connected to the public Internet for infotainment applications but also to safety applications. Like any Internet terminal, some hackers can attack the wireless connectivity unit of the vehicle with Distribution Denial of Services (DDOS) attacks, so that the wireless connectivity unit of the vehicle is not available and the service is lost. Therefore, it is critical to developing a mechanism to detect such an attack and eliminate it, to maintain the availability of the wireless connectivity unit. This paper proposes an algorithm which proceeds in 2 steps: it uses an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to detect DDOS attacks in the incoming Internet data. When it detects an attack, it uses the results of the machine learning algorithm to split the legitimate flow and the rogue flows. The rogue flow is filtered so that the availability of the wireless connectivity unit of the vehicle is restored. This proposed algorithm needs very few CPU computing power and is compatible with low-cost CPUs which are used in an automotive wireless connectivity unit.",10.5121/ijcnc.2019.11102,2-s2.0-85060877617,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85060877617&origin=inward,,1.0,Machine learning algorithm of detection of DOS attacks on an automotive telematic unit,2019

The CBF1 distinguishes different network connection topology of a router by the ""options"" field of IP-V4, encodes the existing DDoS/DoS attacks and all connected device's addresses and stored them. By querying the CBF1, the CBF2 recognizes suspicious packets, accumulates them and sends out super alerts to the victim.

"© 2015 ACM.In recent years, the botnet phenomenon is one of the most dangerous threat to Internet security, which supports a wide range of criminal activities, including distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, click fraud, phishing, malware distribution, spam emails, etc. An increasing number of botnets use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to avoid detection and exclusion by the traditional methods. By dynamically and frequently generating a large number of random domain names for candidate command and control (C&C) server, botnet can be still survive even when a C&C server domain is identified and taken down. This paper presents a novel method to detect DGA botnets using Collaborative Filtering and Density-Based Clustering.

"To effectively counter DDOS attacks from bot herder, Web defenders have developed some approaches to successfully detect and traceback the command and control (C&C) server of botnet for Web security. Yet, available botnet detection schemes assume that all of the ISPs cooperate in providing the routing information required reconstructing the attack path. However, in most practical cases, this assumption cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, the present study proposes a new approach for solving the IP traceback problem in botnets by means of ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm. In the proposed approach, ant-inspired collective intelligence is used to predict the most possible attack path based on a consideration of both the support degree and the confidence degree. The validation of model uses NS2 (Network Simulator, version2) complied by dark IP map, to simulate the scenario of spoofed IP attacks. Finally, the robustness of the proposed scheme toward spoofed IP attacks in investigated.

"We present gore, a routing-assisted defense architecture against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that provides guaranteed levels of access to a network under attack. Our approach uses routing to redirect all traffic destined to a customer under attack to strategically-located gore proxies, where servers filter out attack traffic and forward authorized traffic toward its intended destination. Our architecture can be deployed incrementally by individual ISPs, does not require any collaboration between ISPs, and requires no modifications to either server- or client- software. Clients can be authorized through a web interface that screens legitimate users from outsiders or automated zombies. Authenticated clients are granted limited-time access to the network under attack. The gore architecture allows ISPs to offer DDoS defenses as a value-added service, providing necessary incentives for the deployment of such defenses. We constructed a PC-based testbed to evaluate the performance and scalability of gore. Our preliminary results show that gore is a viable approach, as its impact on the filtered traffic is minimal, in terms of both end-to-end latency and effective throughput.

The CDF attack can exhaust the internal bandwidth of the cluster, the CPU and the memory resources of physical servers. Based on the game theory, IDS and attacker are treated as the two game parties in the VMI-N-IDS model. Utility functions of the two parties are supported, and it is proved that the game model is a non-cooperative and repeated game of incomplete information, and the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium is existent. Finally, the optimal defense strategy is proposed, which is the tradeoff between the false alarm rate and the malicious software size control, for solving the problem of dynamical adjustment strategy of internal intrude detection.

"We present up-to-date metallicity-dependent temperature versus color calibrations for main-sequence and giant stars based on temperatures derived with the infrared flux method (IRFM). Seventeen colors in the photometric systems UBV, uvby, Vilnius, Geneva, RI(Cousins), DDO, Hipparcos-Tycho, and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) have been calibrated. The spectral types covered by the calibrations range from F0 to K5 (7000 K ≳ Teff ≳ 4000 K) with some relations extending below 4000 K or up to 8000 K. Most of the calibrations are valid in the metallicity range -3.5 ≳ [Fe/H] ∼ 0.4, although some of them extend to as low as [Fe/H] ∼ -4.0. All fits to the data have been performed with more than 100 stars; standard deviations range from 30 to 120 K. Fits were carefully performed and corrected to eliminate the small systematic errors introduced by the calibration formulae. Tables of colors as a function of Teff and [Fe/H] are provided. This work is largely based on the study by A. Alonso and collaborators; thus, our relations do not significantly differ from theirs except for the very metal-poor hot stars. From the calibrations, the temperatures of 44 dwarf and giant stars with direct temperatures available are obtained. The comparison with direct temperatures confirms our finding in Paper I that the zero point of the IRFM temperature scale is in agreement, to the 10 K level, with the absolute temperature scale (that based on stellar angular diameters) within the ranges of atmospheric parameters covered by those 44 stars. The colors of the Sun are derived from the present IRFM Teff scale and they compare well with those of five solar analogs. It is shown that if the IRFM Teff scale accurately reproduces the temperatures of very metal-poor stars, systematic errors of the order of 200 K, introduced by the assumption of ( V - K) being completely metallicity independent when studying very metal-poor dwarf stars, are no longer acceptable. Comparisons with other Teff scales, both empirical and theoretical, are also shown to be in reasonable agreement with our results, although it seems that both Kurucz and MARCS synthetic colors fail to predict the detailed metallicity dependence, given that for [Fe/H] = -2.0, differences as high as approximately ±200 K are found. © 2005.

"We present congestion puzzles (CP), a new countermeasure to bandwidth-exhaustion attacks.

Unlike previous puzzle-based approaches, however, ours is the first designed for the bandwidth-exhaustion attacks that are common at the network (IP) layer. At the core of CP is an elegant distributed puzzle mechanism that permits routers to cooperatively impose and check puzzles. We demonstrate through analysis and simulation that CP can effectively defend networks from flooding attacks with-out relying on the formulation of attack signatures to filter traffic. Moreover, as many such attacks are conducted by ""zombie"" computers that have been silently commandeered without the knowledge of their owners, the overheads that CP imposes on heavily engaged zombies can increase the likelihood that the computer's owner detects the compromise and takes action to remedy it.

Traditional middle-box based DDoS attack defense is lack of network-wide monitoring flexibility. With the development of software-defined networking (SDN), it becomes prevalent to exploit centralized controllers to defend against DDoS attacks. However, current solutions suffer with serious southbound communication overhead and detection delay. In this paper, we propose a cross-plane DDoS attack defense framework in SDN, called OverWatch, which exploits collaborative intelligence between data plane and control plane with high defense efficiency. Attack detection and reaction are two key procedures of the proposed framework. We develop a collaborative DDoS attack detection mechanism, which consists of a coarse-grained flow monitoring algorithm on the data plane and a fine-grained machine learning based attack classification algorithm on the control plane. We propose a novel defense strategy offloading mechanism to dynamically deploy defense applications across the controller and switches, by which rapid attack reaction and accurate botnet location can be achieved. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world SDN network. Experimental results validate the efficiency of our proposed OverWatch framework with high detection accuracy and real-Time DDoS attack reaction, as well as reduced communication overhead on SDN southbound interface.",10.1155/2018/9649643,2-s2.0-85041725420,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85041725420&origin=inward,,12.0,OverWatch: A Cross-Plane DDoS Attack Defense Framework with Collaborative Intelligence in SDN,2018

In DDOS attacks, flooding of the particular node as victim and jam it with massive traffic happens and the complete network performance is affected. In this paper, a novel Intrusion Detection and Prevention System is designed which detects the flooding DDOS attacks based on Firecol and prevents the attacks based on Dynamic Growing Self Organizing Tree (DGSOT) for collaborative networks.

"To solve the DoS/DDoS problems efficiently, the first things is to locate the attack origins and then cooperate the filter(s) nearby for dropping abnormal packets in time. The original routers can't provide these functions such as tracking, filtering, and etc. They have to be enhanced with additional functions to defend DoS/DDoS attacks. We refer the enhanced routers as tracers. According to the characteristic, cost and necessity of tracers, three kinds of heterogeneous tracers are selected, namely tunneling-enabled tracers, marking-enabled tracers and filtering-enabled tracers. The tunneling-enabled tracers with the lowest cost can alter the path of the passing packets to destination easily. In this paper, we study how to use tunneling-enabled tracers efficiently to forward packets to the best marking-enabled or filtering-enabled tracer for locating attack origins and filtering abnormal packets in time. Four methods are proposed and compared with the optimal solution.

There are usually many features when we are suffering from a DDoS attacks such as the server CPU is heavily occupied for a long time, bandwidth is hoovered and so on. In distributed cooperative intrusion, the feature information from multiple intrusion detection sources should be analyzed simultaneously to find the spatial correlation among the feature information.In addition to spatial correlation, intrusion also has temporal correlation. Some invasions are gradually penetrating, and attacks are the result of cumulative effects over a period of time. So it is necessary to discover mixed-drove spatiotemporal co-occurrence patterns (MDCOPs) in network security. However, it is difficult to mine MDCOPs from large attack event data sets because mining MDCOPs is computationally very expensive. In information security, the set of candidate co-occurrence attack event data sets is exponential in the number of object-types and the spatiotemporal data sets are too large to be managed in memory. To reduce the number of candidate co-occurrence instances, we present a computationally efficient MDCOP Graph Miner algorithm by using Time Aggregated Graph. which can deal with large attack event data sets by means of file index.

Inter-domain cooperation against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is achieved through the exchange of pushback and feedback messages. The management method is designed not only to prevent network resources from being exhausted by the attacks but also to increase the possibility that legitimate users can fairly access the target services.

"In this paper, we address the problem of botnet detection by correlating information from trusted hosts and network. Botnets are groups of compromised computers controlled by a botmaster through a command and control (C&C) channel. They are noted as one of the foremost security threat causing large scale attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), Spam, mass identity theft and click fraud. Various approaches are used to detect botnets and they range from network to host level detection. To enhance the detection rate, a correlation based model was proposed that combines both host and network level information. Such a model is valid in a network made of trusted hosts. The emergence of smartphones with the capability of mobility and being hosts in different networks, open the door of having untrusted hosts that can reveal fake information. As a solution, we propose a trust-based model that uses cooperative game theory to cluster trusted hosts. The trust is built using the reputation value and it is computed using the hosts' marginal contribution which is derived from Shapley value. Simulation results show that our model improves the detection score compared to the traditional correlation model. Where in one of the simulated scenarios we are able to detect a benign cluster of hosts faster than the traditional correlation model. © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/ICCITechnology.2013.6579517,2-s2.0-84883857171,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84883857171&origin=inward,,1.0,Botnet detection: A cooperative game theoretical correlation-based model,2013
"SYN flooding attacks are a common type of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. Early detection is desirable but traditional passive detection methods are inaccurate in the early stages due to their reliance on passively sniffing an attacking signature. The method presented in this paper captures attacking signatures using an active probing scheme that ensures the efficient early detection. The active probing scheme-DARB obtains the delay of routers by sending packets containing special Time-to-Live set at the IP headers. The results of the probe are used to perform SYN flooding detection, which is reliable and with little overhead. This approach is more independent than other methods that require cooperation from network devices. Experiments show that this delay-probing approach distinguishes half-open connections caused by SYN flooding attacks from those arising from other causes accurately and at an early stage. © 2005 IEEE.",10.1109/ICPADS.2005.67,2-s2.0-23944521338,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=23944521338&origin=inward,,29.0,An active detecting method against SYN flooding attack,2005
"The Internet infrastructure and Internet-based business today still suffer from various attacks like Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks or worm propagations. A necessary first step in order to cope with such large-scale attacks is to provide an Internet-wide detection of such ongoing attacks, i.e., a detection that is not limited to single detection systems only. Therefore, collaborative detection systems were developed in the past. They, however, often rely on close trust relationships, which only rarely are available in the Internet. This means that the scope of detection is limited to only a small part of the Internet, mostly to a single administrative domain. This paper, therefore, introduces our newly developed collaborative attack detection that facilitates collaboration beyond domain boundaries without requiring close trust relationships. In-network detection systems are explicitly considered, too. Such systems are located on routers in the core of the Internet and are characterized by limited resources available for detection. Finally, a detailed simulative evaluation of our proposed solution is presented. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"© 2018 IEEE.In general, a botnet is a collection of compromised internet computers, controlled by attackers for malicious purposes. To increase attacks' success chance and resilience against defence mechanisms, modern botnets have often a decentralized P2P structure. Here, IoT devices are playing a critical role, becoming one of the major tools for malicious parties to perform attacks. Notable examples are DDoS attacks on Krebs on Security and DYN, which have been performed by IoT devices part of botnets. We take a first step towards detecting P2P botnets in IoT, by proposing AutoBotCatcher, whose design is driven by the consideration that bots of the same botnet frequently communicate with each other and form communities. As such, the purpose of AutoBotCatcher is to dynamically analyze communities of IoT devices, formed according to their network traffic flows, to detect botnets. AutoBotCatcher exploits a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain, as a state transition machine that allows collaboration of multiple parties without trust, in order to perform collaborative and dynamic botnet detection by collecting and auditing IoT devices' network traffic flows as blockchain transactions.

"A community network often operates within the same ISP (Internet Service Provider) domain or the network is administered by a virtual organization spanning across multiple network domains with an established trust relationship. To counter DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks in such a federated network environment, the routers can work cooperatively to raise early warning to avoid catastrophic damages. This paper proposes a collaborative architecture to detect DDoS flooding attacks. The scheme appeals, in particular, to protect networked resource centers that work as a collaboration Grid. By monitoring the distribution of suspicious traffic changes over a number of attack-transit routers, we developed a new Change-Aggregation Tree (CAT) mechanism to enable early detection of DDoS attacks on community networks. We want to detect flooding attacks as early as possible. Here, we report preliminary NS-2 simulation results on a single-domain ISP core network to prove the effectiveness of the new collaborative CAT architecture for DDoS defense.

"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to network applications. Many countermeasures have been proposed to tackle such attacks. This paper focuses on DDoS mitigation techniques, the practical way to filter attack traffic and keep victims alive. To rate limit attack traffic with as little normal traffic affected as possible, not just the amount of increased volume, but also how increased traffic is propagated in the network, denoted by traffic increasing patterns, is considered. In this paper, we propose unfair rate limiting (URL), in which traffic aggregates are given different priority by extracting increasing patterns and analyzing their relationship with DDoS attacks. Aggregates more likely to include attacks traffic are punished harder during mitigation. Two URL mechanisms are presented, Local URL (LoURL) and Collaborative URL (CoURL). LoURL works locally, while CoURL deals with locally indeterminate patterns based on global information, and thus achieves more effective mitigation. We evaluate the performance of proposed mechanisms through simulation. The simulation results show that both LoURL and CoURL can effectively mitigate DDoS attacks.

"The Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a challenging problem in the current Internet. Many schemes have been proposed to trace spoofed (forged) attack packets back to their sources. Among them, hop-by-hop schemes are less vulnerable to router compromise than packet marking schemes, but they require accurate attack signatures, high storage or bandwidth overhead, and cooperation of many ISPs. In this paper, we propose honeypot back-propagation, an efficient hop-by-hop traceback mechanism, in which accurate attack signatures are obtained by a novel leverage of the roaming honeypots scheme. The reception of attack packets by a roaming honeypot (a decoy machine camouflaged within a server pool) triggers the activation of a tree of honeypot sessions rooted at the honeypot under attack toward attack sources. The tree is formed hierarchically, first at Autonomous system (AS) level and then at router level. Honeypot back-propagation supports incremental deployment by providing incentives for ISPs even with partial deployment. Against low-rate attackers, most traceback schemes would take a long time to collect the needed number of packets. To address this problem, we also propose progressive back-propagation to handle low-rate attacks, such as on-off attacks with short bursts.

"© 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.Network attacks, including Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), continuously increase in terms of bandwidth along with damage (recent attacks exceed 1.7 Tbps) and have a devastating impact on the targeted companies/governments. Over the years, mitigation techniques, ranging from blackholing to policy-based filtering at routers, and on to traffic scrubbing, have been added to the network operator’s toolbox. Even though these mitigation techniques provide some protection, they either yield severe collateral damage, e.g., dropping legitimate traffic (blackholing), are cost-intensive, or do not scale well for Tbps level attacks (ACL filtering, traffic scrubbing), or require cooperation and sharing of resources (Flowspec). In this paper, we propose Advanced Blackholing and its system realization Stellar. Advanced blackholing builds upon the scalability of blackholing while limiting collateral damage by increasing its granularity. Moreover, Stellar reduces the required level of cooperation to enhance mitigation effectiveness. We show that fine-grained blackholing can be realized, e.g., at a major IXP, by combining available hardware filters with novel signaling mechanisms. We evaluate the scalability and performance of Stellar at a large IXP that interconnects more than 800 networks, exchanges more than 6 Tbps traffic, and witnesses many network attacks every day.

CoDef enables autonomous domains that are uncontaminated by bots to collaborate during link flooding attacks and reroute their customers' legitimate traffic in response to requests from congested routers. Collaborative defense using multi-path routing favors legitimate traffic while limiting the bandwidth available to attack traffic at a congested link.

"© 2019 IEEE.Mobile edge computing (MEC), as an enabling paradigm allowing mobile services to be performed at the edge of mobile networks, has been commonly expected to facilitate real-time services and offload backhaul traffic. However, the security issues raised by innovations in networks always hesitate us to embrace their benefits, and so MEC does. DDoS attacks originating from massive mobile devices in 5G, especially the vulnerable internet-of-things devices, is an unavoidable threat for MEC services. Unfortunately, each MEC node is hard to maintain service availability in the wake of DDoS attacks, owing to its limited hardware resources for defense. Therefore, we are motivated to study the cooperative defense against DDoS attacks for MEC, where defense resources can be shared between MEC nodes. Specifically, we purpose a global orchestration (GO) mechanism to make full use of freedom degrees of cooperative defense with respect to the number of cooperative participants and the amount of cooperative resource. In the process of designing the GO mechanism, we formulate the optimization problem of GO, and exploit the bucket elimination algorithm to find the optimal solutions. To make the GO mechanism practically usable, we propose a scalable approximation algorithm based on the mini-bucket elimination algorithm. Extensive simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of GO.",10.1109/WCNC.2019.8885499,2-s2.0-85074801619,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85074801619&origin=inward,,0.0,Global Orchestration of Cooperative Defense against DDoS Attacks for MEC,2019
"Nowadays we see an increasing number of global network attacks. These attacks are realized due to joint efforts of many distributed malicious software components (bots). It is very hard to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of defense mechanisms against such attacks in practice. However these mechanisms might be simulated with the necessary fidelity.

"A key advantage of SSL VPN is that no specialized client software is required. When a user requests access to a server, the SSL client module, which is a Java applet code, is downloaded into the host at first. However, it is quite likely that not all applications run well, because a client can not connect with a server through an HTTPS tunnel in some applications as we know. Moreover, there is the possibility that we can not use the VPN connections when the SSL port is under Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack. In this paper, we propose a port randomized VPN architecture such that any application can use the VPN and the VPN has strength against DoS or DDoS attack. The proposed VPN uses the same Java applet as existing SSL VPNs use, but the function of the applet, which we call mobile code, is dynamically changed by Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI).

"Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet have become an immediate problem. As DDoS streams do not have common characteristics, currently available intrusion detection systems (IDS) cannot detect them accurately. As a result, defend DDoS attacks based on current available IDS will dramatically affect legitimate traffic. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach to defend against distributed denial of service attacks by coordinating across the Internet. Unlike traditional IDS, we detect and stop DDoS attacks within the intermediate network. In the proposed approach, DDoS defence systems are deployed in the network to detect DDoS attacks independently. A gossip based communication mechanism is used to exchange information about network attacks between these independent detection nodes to aggregate information about the overall network attacks observed. Using the aggregated information, the individual defence nodes have approximate information about global network attacks and can stop them more effectively and accurately. To provide reliable, rapid and widespread dissemination of attack information, the system is built as a peer to peer overlay network on top of the internet.

"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.In the context of future networking technologies, Software-Defined paradigm offers compelling solutions and advantages for traffic orchestration and shaping, flexible and dynamic routing, programmable control and smart application-driven resource management. But the SDN operation has to confront critical issues and technical vulnerabilities, security problems and threats in the enabling technical architecture itself. To address the critical security problems in SDN enabled data centers, we propose a collaborative “Network Security and Intrusion Detection System(NIDS)” scheme called ‘VARMAN: adVanced multi-plAne secuRity fraMework for softwAre defined Networks’. The SDN security scheme comprises of coarse-grained flow monitoring algorithms on the dataplane for rapid anomaly detection and prediction of network-centric DDoS/botnet attacks. In addition, this is combined with a fine-grained hybrid deep-learning based classifier pipeline on the control plane. It is observed that existing ML-based classifiers improve the accuracy of NIDS, however, at the cost of higher processing power and memory requirement, thus unrealistic for real-time solutions. To address these problems and still achieve accuracy and speed, we designed a hybrid model, combining both deep and shallow learning techniques, that are implemented in an improved SDN stack. The data plane deploys attack prediction and behavioral trigger mechanisms, efficient data filtering, feature selection, and data reduction techniques. To demonstrate the practical feasibility of our security scheme in real modern datacenters, we utilized the popular NSL-KDD dataset, most recent CICIDS2017 dataset, and refined it to a balanced dataset containing a comparable number of normal traffic and malware samples. We further augmented the training by organically generating datasets from lab-simulated and public-network hosted hackathon websites. The results show that VARMAN framework is capable of detecting attacks in real-time with accuracy more than 98% under attack intensities up to 50k packets/second. In a multi-controller interconnected SDN domain, the flow setup time improves by 70% on an average, and controller response time reduces by 40%, without incurring additional latency due to security intelligence processing overhead in SDN stack. The comparisons of VARMAN under similar attack scenarios and test environment, with related recent works that utilized ML-based NIDS, demonstrate that our scheme offers higher accuracy, less than 5% false positive rate for various attack intensities and significant training space/time reduction.",10.1016/j.comcom.2019.09.014,2-s2.0-85072873993,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85072873993&origin=inward,,0.0,VARMAN: Multi-plane security framework for software defined networks,2019

However, the existing coordinated DDoS mitigation approaches either they require a complex configuration or are highly-priced. Blockchain technology offers a solution that reduces the complexity of signalling DDoS system, as well as a platform where many autonomous systems (Ass) can share hardware resources and defence capabilities for an effective DDoS defence. In this work, we also used a Deep learning DDoS detection system; we identify individual DDoS attack class and also define whether the incoming traffic is legitimate or attack.

"The main objective of this paper is to propose Adaptive Distributed Critical-Care Extensive Response Network (AD-CERN) which includes self-management and self-defense in the network. The proposed network has the following considerations. (1) Dynamic coevolution is elucidated with interaction between independent rational strategies and structure of overlay network. (2) Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) specific to overlay network is adopted with the combination of network reciprocity and group selection mechanism. (3) The cooperative efficient network structure is put forth by the multinode link-formation game. In this network, each node will be trained independently based on Naïve Bayes classification algorithm to react against any critical services in the network. The proposed network's significant characteristics are self-learning, independent training, collaborative detection, reaction to critical services, protecting the target machine before being collapsed, and maintaining the network performance without any hindrances. It controls the flow of high rate critical services such as Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) flooding attacks and blocks the unwarranted services without any interruption to legitimate users.

"It is of strategic importance for our cyber space security to be able to trace back to the origin of an Internet attack. However, it is particularly challenging due to the evading techniques that attackers use: IP spoofing and attacking across stepping stones. A number of attack traceback methods have been proposed; most of them deal with DoS/DDoS attacks or do not perform well in a non-cooperate or hostile environment. In this contribution, we propose a single packet and host-based traceback scheme. It consists of two phases: Cross-Validation for coping with IP spoofing; and Pebble-Trace for uncovering original attack host location. Cross-Validation is the process that a validation server analyzes an attack packet and determines whether its source IP address is spoofedfor making a decision on the feasibility and strategy of traceback. If a source IP address is invalid, we can only black-list and block it. Otherwise, we propose a new technique called Pebble-Trace to uncover the attack original source by probing packets. While a probing packet from the validation server traverses through stepping stones to the attacker it spreads tracing packets on its way, which ""report"" the IP address of the machine that it traverses (or its payload passes) through back to the validation server. All the trace operations are done automatically and secretly to prevent the attacker from detecting and evading the process. ©2008 IEEE.",10.1109/THS.2008.4534481,2-s2.0-50649121097,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=50649121097&origin=inward,,4.0,Internet attack traceback - Cross-validation and pebble tracing,2008
"© 2015, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.With the increasing demand of data communication in Internet and electronic commerce environments, security of the data is the prime concern. Large-scale collaborative wireless mobile ad hoc networks may face attacks and damages due to harsh behavior of the malicious nodes. To protect the systems from the intrusion of the attackers, security of the system has to be improvised. In researches involving the designing of the intrusion detection system (IDS), performance efficiency of the system is bound to be compromised. For an effective data communication process in the secured system, there is a need for better IDS without reducing the performance metrics. Intrusion detection is the progression of monitoring node movements and data transmission events that occur in a system for possible intrusions. Distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks are the primary threat for security in the collaborative wireless Mobile Ad hoc networks. The attacks due to DDOS are much severe when compared to the non DDOS attacks. So proper preventive measures are necessary to detect and revoke such attacks. Our proposed approach involves trust-based evaluation wherein the intrusion detection is done using secured trust evaluation policies. In this paper, a novel IDS is designed using the trust evaluation metrics. This is used for the detection of the flooding DDOS attacks in the networked architecture. The proposed system combines the existing Firecol-based security procedures with Dynamic Growing Self-Organizing Tree Algorithm in the trust evaluation-based environment.

This paper proposes a newer approach that integrates multi-layer cooperative security intelligence on to a converged Software-Defined-Networking/Network-Function-Virtualization architecture in typical Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) scenario.

"© 2019 IEEE.The increasing number of deployed Internet of Things (IoT) devices is supporting a plethora of new applica-tions that enriches our daily lives. Smart Cities, for instance, leverage IoT to enable new ways of interactions among citizens, government, public services, healthcare, natural resources, waste and energy management. This synergy pushes the participation of individuals and organizations to new levels, strengthening democracy. However, the ubiquity of such devices and their unique characteristics of being numerous, constantly connected to the Internet and having constrained processing capabilities turned IoT into the new target of cyberattacks. Lately, we have witnessed an alarming increase in attack events towards IoT. The most common pattern is usually done in two phases. In the first phase, attackers exploit vulnerabilities in as many devices as possible, turning them into their bots. In the second phase, attackers order bots to dispatch as many request as possible towards a chosen target, flooding them with requests, attempting to exhaust device's computing resources: a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is in place. The traditional targets of massive DDoS attacks are eminent organizations, like financial institutions, governments and online retailers. However, there is space still for small scale DDoS attacks towards IoT devices itself. The main objective would be bringing down IoT devices which firmwares are not easily exploitable, such as security/video surveillance devices.

The attack denies service to legitimate users by flooding and consuming network resources of the target server. We propose a distributed defense mechanism that filters out malicious traffic and allows significant legitimate traffic during an actual attack. We investigate the features of network traffic that can be used to do such filtration and describe a history-based profiling algorithm to identify legitimate traffic. We use Bloom filters to efficiently implement the history-based profile model, which serves to reduce the communication and computation costs. To further improve communication and computation costs, we describe two optimizations: (a) using only three octets of the IP address to generate the history profile, and (b) a data structure called Compacted Bloom Filter, which is a modified version of a regular Bloom filter. We use these notions as building blocks to describe a distributed framework called Collaborative Filtering for filtering attack traffic as far away as possible from the target server. The proposed techniques identify a set of nodes that are best suited for filtering attack traffic, and places the Bloom filters in these locations. The approach is evaluated on different real-world data sets from Auckland University, CAIDA, and Colorado State University. Under different experimental settings, we demonstrate that 70–95% attack traffic can be filtered by our approach while allowing the flow of a similar percentage of legitimate traffic.",10.1007/978-3-030-11039-0_10,2-s2.0-85061125230,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85061125230&origin=inward,,1.0,History-based throttling of distributed Denial-of-service attacks,2019
"Flooding-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks present a serious threat to the stability of the Internet. Identifying the attacks rapidly and accurately is significant for the efficient operation of Internet applications and services. Recent observations in the U.S. indicate a significant increase of cyber attacks on U.S. military information systems in 2009. Current technologies are still unable to withstand largescale DDoS attacks. Single point detection and response is a first step to defeat such distributed attacks. Distributed global defense systems, using a coordinated effort, go much further towards thwarting such attacks. In this paper, we propose a distributed defense infrastructure to detect DDoS attacks globally using a cooperative overlay network and a gossip-based information exchange protocol. Our NS2 based simulation results show that the proposed solution can detect attacks with a detection rate as high as 0.99 with false alarms below 0.01. This compares favorably against other widely known methods including changepoint detection, TTL analysis and wavelet analysis. © 2010 IEEE.",10.1109/NSS.2010.68,2-s2.0-78650311596,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=78650311596&origin=inward,,9.0,Global detection of flooding-based DDoS attacks using a cooperative overlay network,2010
"Denial of Service (DoS) attacks represent, in todays Internet, one of the most serious security threats. A session is under a DoS attack if it cannot achieve its intended throughput due to the misbehavior of other sessions. Many research studies have dealt with DoS, proposing models and/or architectures mostly based on an attack prevention approach. Prevention techniques lead to different models, each suitable for a specific type of misbehavior, but they do not guarantee the protection of a system from a more general DoS attack. In this work we analyze the fundamental requirements to be satisfied in order to protect hosts and routers from any form of Distributed DoS (DDoS). Then we propose a framework which satisfies most of the identified requirements. It appropriately combines Intrusion Detection and Reaction techniques and comprises a number of components actively cooperating in order to effectively react to a wide range of attacks. Functional to our approach is a network signaling protocol, named Active Security Protocol,which allows a set of active routers to interact in order to isolate the sources of a DDoS attack even in the case of address spoofing. As to Intrusion Detection, which plays a major role in the framework, we present a reference model for a real-time network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on Pattern Recognition techniques. First, we describe how network traffic can be effectively represented through the definition of an appropriate set of traffic features. Issues arising when building-up a database for training an IDS will be highlighted, by also taking into account anonymization requirements. The feasibility of the proposed approach will be experimentally demonstrated in terms of both packet loss and detection capability in the presence of real traffic data. Finally, a distributed version of the proposed IDS will be presented.",10.1007/978-0-387-77265-3_7,2-s2.0-84882795741,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84882795741&origin=inward,,0.0,Intrusion detection and reaction: An integrated approach to network security,2008
"© 2018 IEEE.Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are by design highly decentralized and therefore hard to defend against. By utilizing a decentralized, multi-domain, cooperative defense mechanism, it is possible to combine software and hardware capabilities to effortlessly mitigate large scale attacks. Cooperative defense systems face many challenges, such as deployment complexity due to high coordination overhead, reliance on trusted and stable channels for communication and the need for effective incentives to bolster cooperation among all involved parties. In particular, incentives are the key to ensure successful deployment of a 'Mitigation-As-A-Service (MaaS)' for cooperative defense systems. This paper discusses the critical issue of providing a proof of the effectiveness of a cooperative defense mitigation, considering four state-of-The-Art solutions toward an independently verifiable proof of mitigation. A qualitative analysis of these approaches across 9 dimensions shows that none satisfy all requirements due to the inherent trade-offs between practicability and security. As a result, it is identified that the issue of authenticating the underlying network flows remains unsolved.",10.1109/DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTec.2018.00070,2-s2.0-85056892917,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056892917&origin=inward,,4.0,Toward Mitigation-As-A-Service in cooperative network defenses,2018
"In this paper, an analytical model for DDoS attacks detection is proposed, in which propagation of abrupt traffic changes inside public domain is monitored to detect a wide range of DDoS attacks. Although, various statistical measures can be used to construct profile of the traffic normally seen in the network to identify anomalies whenever traffic goes out of profile, we have selected volume and flow measure. Consideration of varying tolerance factors make proposed detection system scalable to the varying network conditions and attack loads in real time. NS-2 network simulator on Linux platform is used as simulation testbed. Simulation results show that our proposed solution gives a drastic improvement in terms of detection rate and false positive rate. However, the mammoth volume generated by DDoS attacks pose the biggest challenge in terms of memory and computational overheads as far as monitoring and analysis of traffic at single point connecting victim is concerned. To address this problem, a distributed cooperative technique is proposed that distributes memory and computational overheads to all edge routers for detecting a wide range of DDoS attacks at early stage.

"Internet is an open network environment, large-scale distributed malicious behaviors is increasing day by day on the internet. Potential relationships may exist among network security incidents which occur at different positions and time. In order to deal with those troubles, this paper presents a Coordinative Running Model (CRM) based on Universal Turing Machine. Formal mathematical definition of the model is proposed. Architecture of the model is hierarchy, and the model consists of several important components, which include storage component, interface system and coordinative running engine etc. On the basis of the above work, a Collaborative Running System (CRS) is implemented for analyzing distributed incidents of backbone network. Furthermore, this model is compared with the Security Operation Center (SOC). For three application scenarios, namely botnet tracking, correlation analysis for alerts of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack and relationship analysis between DDoS attack source and botnet, different types of monitoring devices of the backbone network work together through CRS. The analysis results of typical security incidents data show that CRS is efficient and effective to collaboratively analyze the relations of large-scale security incidents at different time and space, and CRS is a powerful platform for analyzing hidden danger among different incidents.",10.3724/SP.J.1016.2011.00216,2-s2.0-79953645886,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79953645886&origin=inward,,13.0,A model of network device coordinative run,2011

"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) flooding attacks are one of the biggest concerns for security professionals. DDoS flooding attacks are typically explicit attempts to disrupt legitimate users' access to services. Attackers usually gain access to a large number of computers by exploiting their vulnerabilities to set up attack armies (i.e., Botnets). Once an attack army has been set up, an attacker can invoke a coordinated, large-scale attack against one or more targets. Developing a comprehensive defense mechanism against identified and anticipated DDoS flooding attacks is a desired goal of the intrusion detection and prevention research community. However, the development of such a mechanism requires a comprehensive understanding of the problem and the techniques that have been used thus far in preventing, detecting, and responding to various DDoS flooding attacks. In this paper, we explore the scope of the DDoS flooding attack problem and attempts to combat it. We categorize the DDoS flooding attacks and classify existing countermeasures based on where and when they prevent, detect, and respond to the DDoS flooding attacks. Moreover, we highlight the need for a comprehensive distributed and collaborative defense approach. Our primary intention for this work is to stimulate the research community into developing creative, effective, efficient, and comprehensive prevention, detection, and response mechanisms that address the DDoS flooding problem before, during and after an actual attack. © 1998-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/SURV.2013.031413.00127,2-s2.0-84888391622,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84888391622&origin=inward,,543.0,A survey of defense mechanisms against distributed denial of service (DDOS) flooding attacks,2013

"© 2013 IEEE.With the advancement of wireless networking technologies and communication infrastructures, mobile cloud computing has emerged as a pervasive paradigm to execute computing tasks for capacity-limited mobile devices. More specifically, at the network edge, the resource-rich and trusted cloudlet system can provide in-proximity computing services by executing the workloads for nearby devices. Nevertheless, there are chances for malicious users to generate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) flooding tasks to overwhelm cloudlet servers and block computing services from legitimate users. Load balancing is one of the most effective methods to solve DDoS attacks in distributed networks. However, existing solutions require overall load information to achieve load balancing in cloudlet networks, making it costly in both communication and computation. To achieve more efficient and low-cost load balancing, we propose CTOM, a novel collaborative task offloading scheme to avoid DDoS attacks for secure and sustainable mobile cloudlet networks. The proposed solution is based on the balls-and-bins theory and it can balance the task loads with extremely limited information. The CTOM reduces the number of overloaded cloudlets smoothly, thus handling the potential DDoS attacks in mobile cloudlet networks. Extensive simulations and evaluation demonstrate that, the proposed CTOM outperforms the conventional random and proportional allocation schemes in reducing the task gaps between maximum load and minimum load among mobile cloudlets by 65% and 55%, respectively.",10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2853634,2-s2.0-85051649980,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85051649980&origin=inward,,4.0,A novel collaborative task offloading scheme for secure and sustainable mobile cloudlet networks,2018

"To prevent network infrastructure from malicious traffic, such as DDoS attack and scanning, source filtering is widely used in the network. There are different ways to store the filters, e.g., a blacklist of source addresses. Among them, TCAM-based is used as the de facto, because of its wire speed performance. Unfortunately, TCAM is a scarce resource because it's limited by small capacity, high power consumption and high cost. To save storage space, some TCAM-based solutions even block part of the legitimate traffic for better aggregation. Another choice is software based solutions, which have larger storage space compared to hardware based solutions.

As result, this major challenge has attracted the attention of several research works. The attacker is looking for unavailability of service, dysfunctioning of resources and maximization of financial loss costs. There are many types of attack such as Denial of service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) where the key objective for the attacker is to cause an overloading of the system network. They seek to send through a victim server a huge size of data as flooding packets so as to block and prevent the users to be served. This paper introduced a defending system for DoS attack mitigation in CDC environment. Generally, it discussed the different techniques of DoS attacks and its countermeasures as well proactive filtering and detection mechanisms. Consequently, to validate our proposed solution, we have implemented our analytical model in Discrete Event Simulator. The proposed mathematical model considers many performance parameters including response time, throughput, drop rate, resource computing utilization, and mean waiting time in the system, mean number of legitimate clients in the system when varying the attack arrival rate. Indeed, we have estimated the incurred cost from the attack.

"Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks misuse network resource and bring serious threats to the internet. Detecting DDoS at the source-end has many advantages over defense at the victim-end and intermediate-network. However, one of the main problems for source-end methods is the performance degradation brought by these methods and no direct benefit for Internet Service Provider(ISP), which discourages ISPs to deploy the defense system. We propose an efficient detection approach, which only requires limited fixed-length memory and low computation overhead but provides satisfying detection results. Our method is also beneficial because the method can not only detect direct DDoS attack for other ISPs, but also protect the ISP itself from reflector DDoS attack. The efficient and beneficial defense is practical and expected to attract more ISPs to join the cooperation.

"Detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks over the Internet is crucial for many Internet applications, such as electronic commerce, network games, P2P, etc. Based on anomaly detection information, network route selection, Quality of Service (QoS) provision, and traffic engineering can be performed to bypass the abnormal areas or to immigrate the attack traffic. To detect the DDoS attacks in networks outside manageable areas, we need to send probing packets. This paper first surveys the existing available bandwidth estimation tools (ABETs) and divides them into two categories. Most ABETs can measure the available bandwidth of a path over networks, and provide knowledge about the tight link of the path. This paper then presents a method using the ABETs and the bottleneck localization tools to estimate total available bandwidth inside a network from the network edge without additional cooperation of the edge or core routers. The method continuously measures the network bandwidth. The measurement results are then used to detect whether DDoS attacks appear by a special cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm.

"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.The effects of botnet attacks, over the years, have been devastating. From high volume Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to ransomware attacks, it is evident that defensive measures need to be taken. Indeed, there has been a number of successful takedowns of botnets that exhibit a centralized architecture. However, this is not the case with distributed botnets that are more resilient and armed with countermeasures against monitoring. In this paper, we argue that monitoring countermeasures, applied by botmasters, will only become more sophisticated; to such an extent that monitoring, under these adverse conditions, may become infeasible. That said, we present the most detailed analysis, to date, of parameters that influence a P2P botnet’s resilience and monitoring resistance. Integral to our analysis, we introduce BotChurn (BC) a realistic and botnet-focused churn generator that can assist in the analysis of botnets. Our experimental results suggest that certain parameter combinations greatly limit intelligence gathering operations. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the need for extensive collaboration between defenders.

"The National Cyber Security System (NCSS) of South Korea came under criticism when North Korean cyber-terrorists attacked the office computers and servers of major South Korean broadcasting and financial companies on March 20, 2013. The NCSS had evolved up to that time by addressing problems that arose from incidents dating to the January 25, 2003 Internet crisis, the March 4, 2011 distributed denial of service (DDoS) crisis, and other events occurring between those attacks. The above 2013 cyber-terrorism incident magnified the limits of NCSS leadership, expertise, and collaborative systems, while revealing that past reforms were nothing more than stopgap measures.

"Copyright © 2014 American Scientific Publishers.A DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack by definition is any act intended to cause a service to become unavailable or unusable. DDoS flooding attacks are typically attempts to disrupt legitimate users' access to services. DDoS attackers infiltrate large numbers of computers by exploiting software vulnerabilities, to set up DDoS attack networks. To counter DDoS attacks in such a federated network environment, the IP flow can work cooperatively to raise warning in order to avoid catastrophic damages. In this paper, we establish IP flow filtering which is used to select proper features for DDoS detection. A bloom filter is employed to filter the number of zombies involved in a DDoS attack, which is most effective when resources or bandwidth is an issue and small errors can be tolerated. The aim is proposed to get efficiently maximum throughput through the traffic filtering, and its feasibility and validity have been verified in a real network. It provides an affordable and manageable solution to small and medium networks, and enables networks to take control of their own defense within their own network boundaries. The experiment shows that a high throughput can be achieved with low false alarm and without miss alarm. Moreover, it can optimize the network traffic simultaneously with defending against DDoS attacks.",10.1166/sl.2014.3258,2-s2.0-84908470854,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84908470854&origin=inward,,0.0,Distributed denial-of-service attack packet filtering and control mechanisms,2014
"Distributed Denial of Services DDoS, attacks has become one of the biggest threats for resources over Internet. Purpose of these attacks is to make servers deny from providing services to legitimate users. These attacks are also used for occupying media bandwidth. Currently intrusion detection systems can just detect the attacks but cannot prevent / track the location of intruders. Some schemes also prevent the attacks by simply discarding attack packets, which saves victim from attack, but still network bandwidth is wasted. In our opinion, DDoS requires a distributed solution to save wastage of resources. The paper, presents a system that helps us not only in detecting such attacks but also helps in tracing and blocking (to save the bandwidth as well) the multiple intruders using Intelligent Software Agents. The system gives dynamic response and can be integrated with the existing network defense systems without disturbing existing Internet model.

"© 2016 IEEE.Over recent years, network-based attacks evolved to the top concerns responsible for network infrastructure and service outages. To counteract such attacks, an approach is to move mitigation from the target network to the networks of Internet Service Providers (ISP). In addition, exchanging threat information among trusted partners is used to reduce the time needed to detect and respond to large-scale network-based attacks. However, exchanging threat information is currently done on an ad-hoc basis via email or telephone, and there is still no interoperable standard to exchange threat information among trusted partners. To facilitate the exchange of security event information in conjunction with widely adopted monitoring technologies, in particular network flows, we make use of the exchange format FLEX. The goal of this paper is to present a communication process that supports the dissemination of threat information based on FLEX in context of ISPs. We show that this communication process helps organizations to speed up their mitigation and response capabilities without the need to modify the current network infrastructure, and hence make it viable to use for network operators.",10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502852,2-s2.0-84979777140,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84979777140&origin=inward,,7.0,Collaborative DDoS defense using flow-based security event information,2016

"Large-scale attacks like Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks still pose unpredictable threats to the Internet infrastructure and Internet-based business. Thus, many attack detection systems using various anomaly detection methods were developed in the past. These detection systems result in a set of anomalies detected by analysis of the traffic behavior. A realtime identification of the attack type that is represented by those anomalies simplifies important tasks like taking counter-measures and visualizing the network state. In addition, an identification facilitates a collaboration of distributed heterogeneous detection systems. In this paper, we first lay the foundations for a generalized identification system by establishing a model of those entities that form anomaly-based attack detection: large-scale attacks, anomalies, and anomaly detection methods.

Since then DDoS attacks become favourite attacks of antagonists. There are so many different defense techniques available to detect and filter malicious traffic, but none of these methods could adequately filter out the malicious traffic. In this context, this paper proposed a new filtering scheme, Super-router, which uses collaborative filtering technique to filter malicious traffic.

"In recent years, various intrusion detection and prevention systems have been proposed to detect DDoS attacks and mitigate the caused damage. However, many existing IDS systems still keep per-flow state to detect anomaly, and thus do not scale with link speeds in multigigabit networks. In this paper, we present a two-level approach for scalable and accurate DDoS attack detection by exploiting the asymmetry in the attack traffic. In the coarse level, we use a modified count-min sketch (MCS) for fast detection, and in the fine level, we propose a bidirectional count sketch (BCS) to achieve better accuracy. At both detection levels, sketch structures are utilized to ensure the scalability of our scheme. The main advantage of our approach is that it can track the victims of attacks without recording every IP address found in the traffic. Such feature is significant for the detection in the highspeed environment. We also propose a SRAM-based parallel architecture to achieve high-speed process. Furthermore, we analyze accuracy estimation issues to provide hints for practical deployment with constraint memory. We finally demonstrate how to extend our original scheme to a collaborative detection framework. Experimental results using the real Internet traffic show that our approach is able to quickly detect anomaly events and track those victims with a high level of accuracy while it can save over 90% key storage compared with previous sketch-based approaches. © 2011 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.",10.4304/jcm.6.9.660-670,2-s2.0-84255199997,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84255199997&origin=inward,,12.0,A scalable DDoS detection framework with victim pinpoint capability,2011

Facilitated by an innovative and a collaborative large-scale effort, we have conducted discussions with numerous Internet entities to obtain rare and private information related to allocated IP blocks pertaining to the aforementioned sectors and critical infrastructure. To this end, we employ such information to attribute Internet-scale maliciousness to such sectors and realms, in an attempt to provide an in-depth analysis of the global cyber situational posture. We draw upon close to 16.8 TB of darknet data to infer probing activities (typically generated by malicious/infected hosts) and DDoS backscatter, from which we distill IP addresses of victims. By executing week-long measurements, we observed an alarming number of more than 11,000 probing machines and 300 DDoS attack victims hosted by critical sectors. We also generate rare insights related to the maliciousness of various business sectors, including financial, which typically do not report their hosted and targeted illicit activities for reputation-preservation purposes.

The mechanism tackles the attack in three consecutive phases: first, before attack packets can converge to saturate the bandwidth, the victim server through edge routers of its ISP, regulates traffic rate at which traffic load falls below upper bound of its bandwidth (control phase); second, the victim server installs leaky buckets at customer edge routers of all ISPs that have traffic toward it and then, through a feedback control process adjusts the size of leaky buckets appropriately( stabilization phase); third, based on a fingerprint test, the victim server requests those customer edge routers that purely carry good traffic to remove the leaky-bucket and then based on a reference profile fairly adjusts size of leaky-buckets for the remaining customer edge routers such that those routers that carry both good and attack traffic get bigger leaky-bucket sizes compared to those routers that totally carry attack traffic.

These benefits are fueled by innovations in orchestration of cloud platforms that make them totally programmable as Software Defined everything Infrastructures (SDxI). At the same time, sophisticated targeted attacks such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) are growing on an unprecedented scale threatening the availability of online businesses. In this paper, we present a novel defense system called Dolus to mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks launched against high-value services hosted in SDxI-based cloud platforms. Our Dolus system is able to initiate a 'pretense' in a scalable and collaborative manner to deter the attacker based on threat intelligence obtained from attack feature analysis in a two-stage ensemble learning scheme. Using foundations from pretense theory in child play, Dolus takes advantage of elastic capacity provisioning via 'quarantine virtual machines' and SDxI policy co-ordination across multiple network domains to deceive the attacker by creating a false sense of success. From the time gained through pretense initiation, Dolus enables cloud service providers to decide on a variety of policies to mitigate the attack impact, without disrupting the cloud services experience for legitimate users. We evaluate the efficacy of Dolus using a GENI Cloud testbed and demonstrate its real-Time capabilities to: (a) detect DDoS attacks and redirect attack traffic to quarantine resources to engage the attacker under pretense, and (b) coordinate SDxI policies to possibly block DDoS attacks closer to the attack source(s).",10.1145/3154273.3154346,2-s2.0-85041234420,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85041234420&origin=inward,,2.0,Dolus: Cyber defense using pretense against DDoS attacks in cloud platforms,2018

As there is more than one risk-cost analysis, it is beneficial to analyze the used of different risk-cost analysis in an acquaintance management algorithm. We implement three different risk-cost analysis in four different environments of CIDN.

"© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.The Internet of Things (IoT) is a collection of tiny devices deployed with sensors. IoT automates embedded devices and controls them over the Internet. Ubiquitous deployment of IoT introduces a vision for the next generation of the Internet where users, computing systems, and everyday objects possessing sensing and actuating capabilities cooperate with unprecedented convenience and economic benefits. Due to the increased usage of IoT devices, the IoT networks are vulnerable to various security attacks by remote login (like SSH and Telnet). This paper focuses on capturing the attacks on IoT devices using Cowrie honeypot. We employ various machine learning algorithms, namely, Naive Bayes, J48 decision tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify these attacks. This research classifies attacks into various categories such as malicious payload, SSH attack, XOR DDoS, Spying, Suspicious and clean. Feature selection is carried out using subset evaluation and best first search. Once features are selected, we use the proposed SVM model and evaluate its performance with baseline models like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, J48 decision tree. The trained model’s fitness is evaluated on the basis of various metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F-score, where accuracy varies from 67.7% to 97.39%.

"© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) has been one of the biggest threats in the field of network security and a big problem to many researchers and large enterprises for years. In SDN, traditional DDoS attack detection mechanisms are mostly based on intermediate plug-ins or SDN controllers, most of which have problems of large southbound communication overhead, detection delay or lacking network-wide monitoring information. In this paper, we propose a cross-plane cooperative DDoS defense system (CPCS) under the architecture of SDN, which filters abnormal traffic through coarse-grained detection on the data plane and fine-grained detection on the control plane. On the data plane, a preliminary screening is performed to reduce the detection range of the control plane, and the K-means clustering algorithm is used to perform fine-grained analysis of traffic on the control plane. In addition, an anti-false positive module is added ingeniously. The proposed method captures the key characteristics of DDoS attack traffic by polling the value of counters in OpenFlow switches which leverages the computational power of OpenFlow switches that currently not fully utilized. We conducted experiments on a campus network center including OpenFlow switches and RYU controllers. The results show that the framework and traffic monitoring algorithms proposed in this paper can greatly improve detection efficiency and accuracy, and reduce detection delay and southbound communication overhead.",10.1007/978-3-030-34139-8_23,2-s2.0-85076137796,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85076137796&origin=inward,,0.0,A Cross-Plane Cooperative DDoS Detection and Defense Mechanism in Software-Defined Networking,2019
"Ever expanding array of schemes for detection and prevention of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks demands for a constant review and their categorization. As detection techniques have existed for a relatively longer period of time than defense mechanisms, researchers have categorized almost all the existing and expected forthcoming attacks. However, techniques for defense are still nurturing. Researchers have explored that there could be diverse ways of launching DDoS attacks. Consequently, need of defense strategy that adapts and responds autonomously to these variety of attacks is imperative. As more and more excavation is done in the arena of DDoS Defense Mechanisms, we understand that along with the conventional, well known DDoS Prevention and mitigation mechanism there are other factors that play equally important role in shielding a system from DDoS attacks. Deployment strategy, degree of cooperation of the internet host, code of behaviour while the system is already under attack, and post-attack analysis, etc, are such factors. In this paper, we have assorted the existing enormous defense mechanisms, and proposed an enhanced taxonomy that incorporates possible parameters that might influence DDoS Defense. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",10.1007/978-3-642-11207-2_17,2-s2.0-77951521442,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77951521442&origin=inward,,13.0,DDoS defense mechanisms: A new taxonomy,2010
"It is widely recognized that distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks can disrupt web service and cause large revenue losses. However, effective defenses continue to be mostly unavailable. We design a novel DDoS security mechanism, which is a three-layer defense mechanism based on Web servers. Combining the characteristic of the traffic of web servers and aiming at TCP/IP reference model, it utilizes the means of statistical filtering and traffic limit in the network layer, transport layer and application layer to filter the illegitimate traffic to secure the pass of the normal traffic. A majority of illegitimate traffic is filtered by the algorithm of SHCF (Simplified Hop Count Filtering) on network layer. The rest of illegitimate traffic is filtered by the algorithm of SYN Proxy Firewall on transmission layer. And traffic limit is used on the application layer for DDoS attacks using legitimate IP. By the collaborative defense of the threelayer mechanism, sustaining availability of Web services can be ensured under DDoS attacks. The defense mechanism is implemented and tested inside the Linux kernel. The result indicates that the three-layer defense mechanism can defend DDoS attacks effectively. © 2006 IEEE.",10.1109/CHINACOM.2006.344851,2-s2.0-36048982303,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=36048982303&origin=inward,,8.0,A three-layer defense mechanism based on web servers against distributed denial of service attacks,2006
"© 2019 IEEE.The security threats in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment are increasing exponentially with the growth of its applications in diverse disciplines. Due to the inherent nature of resource constrained attributes, IoT networks are susceptible to enormous cyber attacks such as DDoS attack. Though there are many existing solutions to detect and mitigate its devastating impact, most of the solutions are neither suitable in the IoT environment not resilient against collaborative large-scale attacks. In addition, the existing mechanisms do not enable efficiently detecting novel attack vectors. Thus, it necessitates to design a robust and efficient alternative detection model such as based on deep learning applications. The hypothetical model should enable detecting unknown attack patterns that could be thwarted efficiently. In this paper, we analyze the major challenges that might incur in deploying existing solutions in the IoT environment. We also discuss some limitations of proposed techniques that are compatible within IoT networks. In this paper we demonstrate the use of an optimized pattern recognition algorithm to detect such attacks.

We describe a framework that allows SSFs from different domains to negotiate and dynamically control the amount of resources allocated for collaboration, in what we call a 'best-effort' collaboration mode. This SSF collaboration framework creates a distributed mitigation system for handling large scale attacks in a dynamic and scalable manner.

"© 2017 IFIP.Large scale networked systems, such as Identity Management (IdM) systems and software defined networks (SDN), have contributed to technological evolution. They simplify user and network device management. However, they strengthen Distributed Denial-of-Services (DDoS) attacks. These attacks are able to compromise system availability and harm legitimate users. The main approaches against DDoS attacks apply external resources (replication) or try to detect DDoS attacks. The first approach increases solution cost. The second is prone to high false positives. In other contexts, research into resilient approaches has increased for addressing emergent threats. In this work, we advocate that networked systems can self-manage to provide resilience. We propose a framework to guide the system design to follow the ideas defended in this thesis. The framework comprises the survival, collaboration, and analysis modules. Following the framework, networked systems can preserve their lifetime without external computer resources. The DDoS attack mitigation process starts when the system capacity overcomes a pre-established threshold. A protocol and a scheme showcase the framework over IdM systems and SDN.

"© 2016 IEEE.As DNS packet are mostly UDP-based, make it as a perfect platform for hackers to launch a well-known type of distributed denial of service (DDoS). The purpose of this attack is to saturate the DNS server availability and resources with unwanted DNS query traffic. This type of attack utilizes a large number of botnet and usually perform spoofing on the IP address of the targeted victim. While it is difficult to identify which one is legitimate or attack traffic, we take a different approach for spoofing detection strategies to protect the DNS server by utilizing Software Defined Networking (SDN). In this paper, we present CAuth, a novel mechanism that autonomously block the spoofing packet while authenticate the legitimate query. By manipulating Openflow control message, we design a collaborative approach between client and server network. Whenever a server controller receives query packet, it will send an authentication packet back to the client network and later the client controller also reply via authentication packet back to the server controller. The server controller will only forward the query to the respective server if it receives the replied authentication packet from the client. From the evaluation, CAuth instantly manage to block spoofing query packet while authenticate the legitimate query as soon as the mechanism started.",10.1109/COMPSAC.2016.6,2-s2.0-84987957361,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84987957361&origin=inward,,2.0,Collaborative Spoofing Detection and Mitigation - SDN Based Looping Authentication for DNS Services,2016
"© IFCA/Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.One of the unique features of the digital currency Bitcoin is that new cash is introduced by so-called miners carrying out resourceintensive proof-of-work operations. To increase their chances of obtaining freshly minted bitcoins, miners typically join pools to collaborate on the computations. However, intense competition among mining pools has recently manifested in two ways. Miners may invest in additional computing resources to increase the likelihood of winning the next mining race. But, at times, a more sinister tactic is also employed: a mining pool may trigger a costly distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack to lower the expected success outlook of a competing mining pool. We explore the trade-off between these strategies with a series of game-theoretical models of competition between two pools of varying sizes. We consider differences in costs of investment and attack, as well as uncertainty over whether a DDoS attack will succeed. By characterizing the game’s equilibria, we can draw a number of conclusions. In particular, we find that pools have a greater incentive to attack large pools than small ones.

Unlike traditional IDS. we detect DDoS at the intermediate network. Our scheme uses a nonparametric point detection method to improve the detection accuracy at each individual node. Then, a gossip based multicast mechanism is used to exchange information between the individual nodes to further improve the detection accuracy.

"DDoS attacks can cause extreme performance degradation at network elements when a large number of malicious flows collaborate to cause congestion, resulting in a denial of service to legitimate users. The flows form a logical aggregate which is typically characterized by similar values in several fields in their packets. The fields and their similar values form a signature for the attack. The focus of this paper is on providing protection to legitimate users against such attacks by detecting significant signatures in network traffic and controlling aggregates of flows carrying these signatures. The paper proposes a system PISA* for deployment at a network element. The detection algorithm in PISA* is based on an improved version of our earlier randomized algorithm. A new control mechanism based on a drop probability function over an attribute named RED Drop Aggregate (RDA) is incorporated in PISA*. RDA is the normalized count of the number of RED (Random Early Detection) drops suffered by the flows carrying a signature.

Despite many researchers' efforts, no optimal solution that addresses all sorts of HTTP DoS/DDoS attacks is on offer. Therefore, this research aims to fix this gap by designing an alternative solution called a flexible, collaborative, multilayer, DDoS prevention framework (FCMDPF). The innovative design of the FCMDPF framework handles all aspects of HTTP-based DoS/DDoS attacks through the following three subsequent framework's schemes (layers). Firstly, an outer blocking (OB) scheme blocks attacking IP source if it is listed on the black list table. Secondly, the service traceback oriented architecture (STBOA) scheme is to validate whether the incoming request is launched by a human or by an automated tool. Then, it traces back the true attacking IP source. Thirdly, the flexible advanced entropy based (FAEB) scheme is to eliminate high rate DDoS (HR-DDoS) and flash crowd (FC) attacks.

"As more and more services are provided by servers via the Internet, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks pose an increasing threat to the Internet community. A DoS attack overloads the target server with a large volume of adverse requests, thereby rendering the server unavailable to ""well-behaved"" users. Recently, the novel paradigm of traffic ownership that enables the clients of Internet service providers (ISP) to configure their own traffic processing policies has gained popularity. In this paper, we propose two algorithms belonging to this paradigm that allow attack targets to dynamically filter their incoming traffic based on a distributed policy. The proposed algorithms defend the target against DoS and distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks and simultaneously ensure that it continues to receive valuable users' traffic. In a nutshell, a target can define a filtering policy which consists of a set of traffic classification rules and the corresponding amounts of traffic, measured in bandwidth units, which match each rule. The filtering algorithm is enforced by the ISP's or the Network Service Provider's (NSP) routers when a target is being overloaded with traffic. The goal Is to maximize the amount of filtered traffic forwarded to the target, according to the filtering policy, from the ISP's or the NSP's network. The first algorithm we propose relies on complete collaboration among the ISP/NSP routers. It computes the filtering policy in polynomial time and delivers the best possible traffic mix to the target. The second algorithm is a distributed algorithm which assumes no collaboration among the ISP/NSP routers, each router only uses local information about its incoming traffic. We show the intuition behind the proof of lower bound on the second algorithm's worst-case performance. © 2009 IEEE.",10.1109/PDCAT.2009.40,2-s2.0-77950993448,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77950993448&origin=inward,,3.0,Trawling traffic under attack overcoming DDoS attacks by target-controlled traffic filtering,2009

In this architecture, when a protected web server is under attacks, the traffic to the server will be redirected to an overlay via IP anycast. The overlay nodes provide effective protection to the server by the distributed filter, the distributed traffic control, and also by building a temporary collaborative edge web cache. We demonstrate that this novel architecture has strong incentives to deploy and is able to be deployed by a single ISP without any modifications to implementation of routers and end host. We then discuss its properties and design challenges. © 2008 IEEE.",10.1109/ICYCS.2008.509,2-s2.0-58349105000,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=58349105000&origin=inward,,0.0,A deployable architecture against application-level DDoS attacks,2008
"In March of 2013, what started as a minor dispute between Spamhaus and Cyberbunker quickly escalated to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that was so massive, it was claimed to have slowed internet speeds around the globe. The attack clogged servers with dummy internet traffic at a rate of about 300 gigabits per second. By comparison, the largest observed DDoS attacks typically against banks had thus far registered only 50 gigabits per second. The record breaking Spamhaus/Cyberbunker conflict arose 13 years after the publication of best practices on preventing DDoS attacks, and it was not an isolated event. Recently, NYU's Courant Institute and Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute have collaboratively devised a game-theoretic approaches to address various cyber security problems involving exchange of information (asymmetrically). This research aims to discover and understand complex structures of malicious use cases within the context of secure systems with the goal of developing an incentives-based measurement system that ensures a high level of resilience to attack. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",10.1007/978-3-319-04483-5_4,2-s2.0-84958523035,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84958523035&origin=inward,,16.0,Cyber security via signaling games: Toward a science of cyber security,2014
"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most rampant attacks in the modern Internet of Things (IoT) network infrastructures. Security plays a very vital role for an ever-growing heterogeneous network of IoT nodes, which are directly connected to each other. Due to the preliminary stage of Software Defined Networking (SDN), in the IoT network, sampling based measurement approaches currently results in low-accuracy, higher memory consumption, higher-overhead in processing and network, and low attack-detection. To deal with these aforementioned issues, this paper proposes sFlow and adaptive polling based sampling with Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and deep learning based model, which helps to lower down the various types of prevalent DDoS attacks inside the IoT network. The flexible decoupling property of SDN enables us to program network devices for required parameters without utilizing third-party propriety based hardware or software. Firstly, in data-plane, to lower down processing and network overhead of switches, we deployed sFlow and adaptive polling based sampling individually. Secondly, in control-plane, to optimize detection accuracy, we deployed Snort IDS collaboratively with Stacked Autoencoders (SAE) deep learning model. Furthermore, after applying performance metrics on collected traffic streams, we quantitatively investigate trade off among attack detection accuracy and resources overhead. The evaluation of the proposed system demonstrates higher detection accuracy with 95% of True Positive rate with less than 4% of False Positive rate within sFlow based implementation compared to adaptive polling.",10.1016/j.future.2019.10.015,2-s2.0-85076207952,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85076207952&origin=inward,,0.0,Towards sFlow and adaptive polling sampling for deep learning based DDoS detection in SDN,2019

In this new age, systems are set to become more densely intraconnected and interconnected, and massive sociotechnical systems exhibiting unprecedented levels of complexity will increasingly take hold. At the dawning of this new age, the Ergonomics discipline must reflect on its preparedness for tackling problems in these novel systems. This paper engages in this reflection by putting forth a critical commentary on the implication of these changes on the discipline and discusses the utility of our current methods in this new paradigm. A resulting Radical Systems Thinking in Ergonomics Manifesto is put forward–a set of mandates to guide practitioners and researchers in the development of new methods capable of coping with these imminent challenges. From the manifesto are derived a series of capability requirements for future computational modelling approaches in Ergonomics. Practitioner summary: The goal of this paper was to inspire the Ergonomics community to pursue further applications involving computational modelling approaches such as Agent-Based Modelling. It presents a manifesto for the future of the discipline, and from this the capabilities that future computational modelling approaches need to possess.

"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are the most common and easiest attacks to propagate over internet. It causes a high degree of destruction to the network and systems resources. The destructive nature of DDoS attacks force security engineers to design defense solutions which can detect and take counter actions to defend against such attacks. In this paper, we investigated the packet flood attacks and presented a collaborative peer to peer defense mechanism. The proposed solution detects the attack at victim edge router and sends the alert messages to its neighboring nodes which allow them to proactively defend themselves. Simulation results shows the efficiency of the solution with less false positives at victim edge router and less damage to the network due to proactive defense approach. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.procs.2011.07.022,2-s2.0-84856479963,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84856479963&origin=inward,,14.0,Collaborative peer to peer defense mechanism for DDoS attacks,2011
"In recent years, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have brought increasing threats to the Internet since attack traffic caused by DDoS attacks can consume lots of bandwidth or computing resources on the Internet and the availability of DDoS attack tools has become more and more easy. However, due to the similarity between DDoS attack traffic and transient bursts of normal traffic, it is very difficult to detect DDoS attacks accurately and quickly. In this paper, a novel DDoS detection approach based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and cooperative reinforcement learning is proposed, where a distributed cooperation detection scheme using source IP address monitoring is employed. To realize earlier detection of DDoS attacks, the detectors are distributed in the mediate network nodes or near the sources of DDoS attacks and HMMs are used to establish a profile for normal traffic based on the frequencies of new IP addresses. A cooperative reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to compute optimized strategies of information exchange among the distributed multiple detectors so that the detection accuracies can be improved without much load on information communications among the detectors. Simulation results on distributed detection of DDoS attacks generated by TFN2K tools illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,2-s2.0-38049169479,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=38049169479&origin=inward,,22.0,Defending DDoS attacks using hidden Markov models and cooperative reinforcement learning,2007
"© 2018 ACM.Owing1 to an immense growth of internet-connected and learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPSs) [1], several new types of attack vectors have emerged. Analyzing security and resilience of these complex CPSs is difficult as it requires evaluating many subsystems and factors in an integrated manner. Integrated simulation of physical systems and communication network can provide an underlying framework for creating a reusable and configurable testbed for such analyses. Using a model-based integration approach and the IEEE High-Level Architecture (HLA) [2] based distributed simulation software; we have created a testbed for integrated evaluation of large-scale CPS systems. Our tested supports web-based collaborative metamodeling and modeling of CPS system and experiments and a cloud computing environment for executing integrated networked co-simulations. A modular and extensible cyber-attack library enables validating the CPS under a variety of configurable cyber-attacks, such as DDoS and integrity attacks. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation is also supported along with several hardware attacks. Further, a scenario modeling language allows modeling of alternative paths (Courses of Actions) that enables validating CPS under different what-if scenarios as well as conducting cyber-gaming experiments. These capabilities make our testbed well suited for analyzing security and resilience of CPS. In addition, the web-based modeling and cloud-hosted execution infrastructure enables one to exercise the entire testbed using simply a web-browser, with integrated live experimental results display.",10.1145/3167132.3167173,2-s2.0-85050532585,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85050532585&origin=inward,,1.0,Integrated simulation testbed for security and resilience of CPS,2018
"Copyright © 2016 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.DDoS remains a major threat to Software Defined Networks. To keep SDN secure, effective detection techniques for DDoS are indispensable. Most of the newly proposed schemes for detecting such attacks on SDN make the SDN controller act as the IDS or the central server of a collaborative IDS. The controller consequently becomes a target of the attacks and a heavy loaded point of collecting traffic. A collaborative intrusion detection system is proposed in this paper without the need for the controller to play a central role. It is deployed as a modified artificial neural network distributed over the entire substrate of SDN. It disperses its computation power over the network that requires every participating switch to perform like a neuron. The system is robust without individual targets and has a global view on a large-scale distributed attack without aggregating traffic over the network.

In addition, a trusted routing protocol is proposed that, using context-based information such as link stability and trust information, delivers data through the most reliable way. In this study, the simulation results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of our trust framework at detecting dishonest nodes, as well as malicious messages that are sent by honest or dishonest nodes, after a very low number of message exchanges. Furthermore, colluding attacks are detected in a small period of time, which results in network resources being released immediately after an overload period.

"© 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.The DDoS attack is a serious security problem in today’s Internet. To defend DDoS attacks, distributed routers need to cooperate to guarantee servers’ safety. Existing rule-based methods are not ideal as these methods adjust a threshold, which lacks flexibility. The distributed DDoS defense problem can also be viewed as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MAMDP), where multiple agents intelligently coordinate to achieve a team goal. However, agents can hardly defend DDoS attacks without communication.

"Current endoscopic anatomy interposes the gastric cardia between the tubular oesophagus and the proximal stomach. In contrast to that, recent evidence unfolds a different view. Using PubMed and Scopus searches, we examined if the novel understanding regarding the cardia goes in line with the concept of unfolding, as described by Heidegger based on the ancient didactic poetry of Parmenides. What has been taken as gastric cardia in fact represents reflux-damaged, dilated, columnar lined oesophagus (CLO): dilated distal oesophagus (DDO). Due to its macroscopic gastric appearance it cannot be discriminated from the stomach by endoscopy. Differentiation between DDE and proximal stomach requires the histopathology of measured multi-level biopsies obtained from the DDO and the proximal stomach. Cardaic, onxytocardiac mucosa and intestinal metaplasia (IM; Barrett's oesophagus) define CLO and thus the oesophageal location, while oxyntic mucosa (OM) of the proximal stomach verifies a gastric biopsy location. Endoscopically visible CLO and DDO define the morphological manifestation of reflux: the squamo-oxyntic gap (SOG). Biopsies obtained from the level of the diaphragmatic impressions allow differentiation between an enlarged hiatus with normal anatomic content (CLO; oesophagus) vs. hernia with abnormal content (OM; stomach). Non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus exists in 10 %-17 % of asymptomatic and in 20 %-100 % (with increasing CLO length) of reflux symptom-positive individuals (annual cancer risk: 0.2 %-0.7 %). These data justify biopsy of an endoscopically normal appearing squamocolumnar junction for the exclusion of Barrett's oesophagus and cancer risk. In the absence of contraindications, cancer risk-based therapy of dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus includes radiofrequency ablation (RFA) ± endoscopic resection. The perception of the cardia as reflux damaged DDO mirrors the concept of unfolding, as described by the interpretation of the didactic poem of Parmenides by Heidegger. Our data recommend to omit the term cardia and allocate morphology either to the oesophagus (CLO, DDO) or to the proximal stomach or indicate that allocation is impossible (i. e. tumour-induced). Future studies will have to test the value of this novel concept for diagnosis, treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and cancer prevention. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",10.1055/s-0034-1366188,2-s2.0-84898422610,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84898422610&origin=inward,,2.0,Critical assessment of a new endoscopic anatomic concept for the so-called cardia in the sense of the notions of parmenides and martin heidegger Kritische Betrachtung neuer Konzepte zur endoskopischen Anatomie des ösphagogastralen Übergangs im Sinne des Denkens von Parmenides und Martin Heidegger,2014

"© 2020DDoS attack has emerged as a security threat to the services provided by internet service providers. The DDoS attack creates a huge danger to the availability of internet resources and services to legitimate users. Regardless of the presence of many defense mechanisms, the availability of bandwidth, security of computing resources are the challenges of on-going research. The increased rate of legitimate traffic flow and its similarity with the attack traffic flow made the DDoS problem more crucial. This paper proposed a distributed attack detection mechanism system called T-CAD that detects and mitigates the influence of DDoS attacks by observing traffic on the edge routers of autonomous systems. T-CAD computes the normalized router entropy and compares it to the various thresholds to efficiently discriminate between legitimate traffic, DDoS attack and flash events. The proposed attack detection system has been validated by performing simulation experiments with OMNeT++ and INET. The outcome of the simulation experiments shows that the T-CAD defense system has outperformed many existing thresholds and entropy-based DDoS attack detection mechanisms on several performance measures.",10.1016/j.jisa.2020.102457,2-s2.0-85079560612,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85079560612&origin=inward,,0.0,T-CAD: A threshold based collaborative DDoS attack detection in multiple autonomous systems,2020
"Botnets are extremely versatile and are used in many attacks, for example, sending huge volumes of spam or launching Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. With the development of network technology, suppressing botnets become more and more difficult. There are many reasons, firstly, the bot master will keep their own botnets as small as possible not only to hide themselves but also to rent the botnets in an easy way, secondly, bots can automatically change their command and control server (C&C) in order to hide and rescue themselves. Completely suppressing botnets is an extremely difficult challenge, but is not impossible. In this paper, we present an automatic and distributed botnets suppressing system called Garlic. Its structure is very similar to garlic, whose cloves are also distributed. This system can automatically collect network traffic from the botnet in a distributed mode, and then process these huge data using cloud computing technology, the Garlic system will generate and distribute rules when botnets are detected in data analysis. The most important feature of the Garlic is its close loop control characteristics, i.e., gather the feedback events resulted from the deployed rules, process and analyze in central node, and regenerate more effective rules to further suppress the new variant botnets.

"© 2018 Elsevier B.V.Cloud-hosted services are being increasingly used in online businesses in e.g., retail, healthcare, manufacturing, entertainment due to benefits such as scalability and reliability. These benefits are fueled by innovations in orchestration of cloud platforms that make them programmable as Software Defined everything Infrastructures (SDxI). At the same time, sophisticated targeted attacks such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are growing on an unprecedented scale threatening the availability of online businesses. In this paper, we present a novel defense system called Dolus to mitigate the impact of targeted attacks launched against high-value services hosted in SDxI-based cloud platforms. Our Dolus system is able to initiate a ‘pretense’ in a scalable and collaborative manner to deter the attacker based on threat intelligence obtained from attack feature analysis. Using foundations from pretense theory in child play, Dolus takes advantage of elastic capacity provisioning via ‘quarantine virtual machines’ and SDxI policy co-ordination across multiple network domains to deceive the attacker by creating a false sense of success. We evaluate the efficacy of Dolus using a GENI Cloud testbed and demonstrate its real-time capabilities to: (a) detect DDoS and APT attacks and redirect attack traffic to quarantine resources to engage the attacker under pretense, (b) coordinate SDxI policies to possibly block attacks closer to the attack source(s).",10.1016/j.future.2018.10.004,2-s2.0-85056866180,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85056866180&origin=inward,,0.0,Intelligent defense using pretense against targeted attacks in cloud platforms,2019

"This work combines two existing defenses against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks - DefCOM and Speak-up - resulting in a synergistic improvement. DefCOM defense organizes existing source-end, victim-end and core defenses into a collaborative overlay to filter DDoS floods. Source networks that do not participate in DefCOM often receive poor service and their traffic is severely rate-limited. This is because core nodes in DefCOM that perform filtering lack cheap algorithms to differentiate legitimate from attack traffic at line speed - they must conservatively assume all high-rate traffic from legacy networks to be attack. Thus, in its attempt to mitigate DDoS, DefCOM ends up denying service during attacks to legitimate hosts that reside in legacy networks. Speak-up is a recently proposed defense, which invites all clients of the DDoS victim to send additional payment traffic, with the assumption that attack machines are already sending close to their full capacity. Clients that send a lot of payment traffic are considered legitimate and whitelisted. Speak-up is relatively cheap to deploy at the clients and the DDoS victim, but since payment traffic needs to be sent continuously, this creates additional congestion at the victim, which is undesirable. We combine Speak-up and DefCOM into a synergistic defense that addresses the shortcomings of the individual defenses and confirms the success of collaborative protection against DDoS attacks. Speak-up is integrated with core defenses in DefCOM and whitelists clients based on their payment traffic. Legitimate clients in legacy networks can thus be detected and served. Further, since Speak-up is implemented in the core, payment and attack traffic do not reach the victim and any undesirable congestion effects are localized to the vicinity of legacy networks. ©2008 IEEE.",10.1109/ICC.2008.329,2-s2.0-51249104641,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=51249104641&origin=inward,,5.0,Combining speak-up with DefCOM for improved DDoS defense,2008
"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are threats not only for the direct targets but also for the core of the network. They are also hard to detect in advance, hence methods to deal with them need to be proactive. By building on earlier work and improving on distribution of control aspects, we propose a Cluster Based framework, which is called CluB, to mitigate DDoS attacks; the method balances the effectiveness-overhead trade-off by addressing the issue of granularity of control in the network. CluB can collaborate with different routing policies in the network, including contemporary datagram options. We estimate the effectiveness of the framework and also study a set of factors for tuning the granularity of control. © 2011 ACM.",10.1145/1982185.1982297,2-s2.0-79959316635,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=79959316635&origin=inward,,9.0,CluB: A cluster based framework for mitigating distributed denial of service attacks,2011
"One of the fundamental limitations of the Internet is the inability of a packet flow recipient to halt disruptive flows before they consume the recipient's network link resources. Critical infrastructures and businesses alike are vulnerable to DoS attacks or flash-crowds that can incapacitate their networks with traffic floods. Unfortunately, current mechanisms require per-flow state at routers, ISP collaboration, or the deployment of an overlay infrastructure to defend against these events. In this paper, we present SIFF, a Stateless Internet Flow Filter, which allows an end-host to selectively stop individual flows from reaching its network, without any of the common assumptions listed above. We divide all network traffic into two classes, privileged (prioritized packets subject to recipient control) and unprivileged (legacy traffic). Privileged channels are established through a capability exchange handshake. Capabilities are dynamic and verified statelessly by the routers in the network, and can be revoked by quenching update messages to an offending host. SIFF is transparent to legacy clients and servers, but only updated hosts will enjoy the benefits of it.",10.1109/SECPRI.2004.1301320,2-s2.0-3543097593,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=3543097593&origin=inward,,218.0,SIFF: A stateless internet flow filter to mitigate DDoS flooding attacks,2004

"© 2017 ACM.Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most common but destructive kind of cyberattacks. The DDoS attack traffic vastly includes the SYN packets. To handle excessive DDoS traffic without large impact on the benign traffic, it is important to allocate sufficient resource for the defense. With the support from Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technology, this can be done in a significantly lower lower cost, with higher flexibility. In this work, we propose a DDoS defense mechanism based on Network Function Virtualization platform, which is capable to balance with the attack load. Our proposed mechanism uses dynamic network agents to intercept packets when the system experiences DDoS attack. In particular, we focus on the mechanism that deploys virtual agents dynamically according to the attack strength. The corresponding load-balancing algorithm dynamically determines the number of agents to allocate for defending the attack traffic. Our simulation results demonstrate that the mechanism can successfully defeat the DDoS attacks with different attack intensities, while it incurs minimal performance degradation on the benign traffic and keeps the increase in the server's response time sufficiently low compared to that of a successful DDoS attack.",10.1145/3040992.3041000,2-s2.0-85018351048,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85018351048&origin=inward,,6.0,Dynamic DDoS defense resource allocation using Network Function Virtualization,2017

The defense methods rely on random or probabilistic means to detect illegitimate traffic and discard it, which necessitates that a certain percentage of legitimate packets be dropped in the process, reducing the overall Quality of Service.

To address these security concerns, this paper proposes a biologically inspired security framework that governs the cooperation among network entities to identify security attacks, to perform security updates, and to inhibit attacks propagation in the heterogeneous network.

"© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one of the prominent risk factors for the development of cloud service. It is a very hard task for novice cloud users to identify the real source of DDoS attack because of the attacker spoofs the internet protocol (IP) and media access control (MAC) addresses. To address this problem, we propose a third party auditor (TPA) based packet traceback approach. The method uses Weibull distribution for analyzing the source of the DDoS attack. The approach provides an efficient and fruitful solution because of its strong identification factor. The identification factor depends upon the weaknesses left by the intruder. We analyze the traffic pattern to generate attack alert for different cloud users. The advantage of this approach is that it reduces the overhead on the cloud user. With the help of Weibull distribution, we can easily obtain the availability, reliability and median life of DDoS defense in the cloud environment. To demonstrate our approach, we implement an application based on Hadoop and MapReduce framework. We tested this application based on various parameters.

"In the past few years, the network measurement community has been interested in the problem of internet topology discovery using a large number (hundreds or thousands) of measurement monitors. The standard way to obtain information about the internet topology is to use the traceroute tool from a small number of monitors. Recent papers have made the case that increasing the number of monitors will give a more accurate view of the topology. However, scaling up the number of monitors is not a trivial process. Duplication of effort close to the monitors wastes time by reexploring well-known parts of the network, and close to destinations might appear to be a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack as the probes converge from a set of sources towards a given destination. In prior work, authors of this paper proposed Double-tree, an algorithm for cooperative topology discovery, that reduces the load on the network, i.e., router IP interfaces and end-hosts, while discovering almost as many nodes and links as standard approaches based on traceroute.

"© 2018 IFIP.Traditionally, internal networks rely on border firewalls as the first line of defence against untrusted external networks. However, customized security measures can begin further away. We have already noticed proliferating deployment of Software Defined Networking (SDN) in internal networks, and even further within the Internet core, at Internet Exchange Points (IXP). Software-Defined Internet Exchange Points (SDX) enable flexible and programmable control over the delivery of wide area network traffic. Therefore, SDX's are an appealing place to introduce security actions that span beyond the edge of internal networks. By extending security actions to SDX's, dedicated border security appliances would no longer be as overwhelmed and wide area network links would no longer deliver traffic only to be dropped at the edge of the destination networks. In this paper we present a hierarchical, logically centralized architecture enabling SDX security policies to be expressed by the Autonomous Systems (AS) as intents. Through SDX collaboration, these security intents can be compiled and installed at the closest available SDX relative to the offending source. Moreover, parallel intent compilation over multiple selected SDX's can be simultaneously executed, thus enabling a distributed security response activated at the Internet core. This approach that relies on SDX's allows faster adoption in contrast to changing all routers, or the Internet architecture.

Meanwhile the network control theory is applied to establish a network confrontation's control model for DDoS to control the active defense process. It provides a new idea to solve the DDoS problem. © 2013 SPIE.",10.1117/12.2011685,2-s2.0-84880178811,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84880178811&origin=inward,,0.0,Active defense scheme against DDoS based on mobile agent and network control in network confrontation,2013
"Grid aims at utilising resources efficiently through coordinated resource sharing and problem solving in a virtual organisation spanning geographical boundaries. A three-tier grid architecture consisting of Service Providers or Resource Provider (SP/RP), brokers and Regional Resource Administrators (RRA), is secured using DDoS attack defense mechanism and spam filtering mechanisms that endeavour to optimise the resource utilisation. An overlay network of Anomaly Detection Agents (ADA) is set up at the RRA level which enables deployment of collaborative defense mechanisms. The presence of these mechanisms minimises the wastage of resources which can be put to effective use in grid applications. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJAHUC.2010.032999,2-s2.0-77952116480,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=77952116480&origin=inward,,1.0,Secured and trusted three-tier grid architecture,2010
"© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.The Cooperative Intrusion Traceback and Response Architecture (CITRA) [1] and the Intruder Detection and Isolation Protocol (IDIP) [2] provide an infrastructure that enables intrusion detection systems, firewalls, routers, and other components to cooperatively trace and block network intrusions as close to their sources as possible. We present the results of recent testbed experiments using CITRA and IDIP to defend streaming multimedia sessions against the Stacheldraht DDoS toolkit. Experimental data suggests that these technologies represent a promising approach for autonomic DDoS defense.",,2-s2.0-84947605641,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84947605641&origin=inward,,6.0,Autonomic response to distributed denial of service attacks,2015
"The main objective of this paper is to design Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) based overlay network structure with the combination of network reciprocity and group selection mechanisms to achieve evolutionary cooperation among individual nodes. Each node in the proposed network structure has ability to detect the DDoS attacks using Non-parametric sliding window based change point detection algorithm. It analyzes every incoming traffic behavior changes and generates the attack patterns based on the traffic profile. The proposed network structure is considered as a tree like structure in the experimental analysis, which monitors the network traffic and provides faster detection during the distributed flooding attack. As a result, our network detects the DDoS attacks at the intermediate stage itself with the sharing nature of attack patterns, without any interruption to legitimate users. Moreover, it provides excellent detection accuracy (98%) and high degree of efficiency during high probability of network traffic. © 2012 IEEE.",10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206760,2-s2.0-84862897330,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84862897330&origin=inward,,2.0,Design of an early response system using EGT-based overlay network,2012
"The Human Immune System (HIS) plays an important role in protecting the human body from various intruders ranging from naive germs to the most sophisticated viruses. It acts as an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) for the human body and detects anomalies that make the body deviate from its normal behavior. This inspired researchers to build Artificial Immune Systems (AISes) which imitate the behavior of the HIS and are capable of protecting hosts or networks from attacks. An Artificial Immune System (AIS) is capable of detecting novel attacks because it is trained to differentiate between the normal behavior (self) and the abnormal behavior (non-self) during a tolerization (i.e training) period. Although several AISes have been proposed, only a few make use of collaborative approaches. In this paper we propose P2P-AIS, a P2P approach for AISes in which peers exchange intrusion detection experience in order to enhance attack detection and mitigation. P2P-AIS implements Chord as a distributed hash table (DHT) protocol to organize the peers. © 2009 IEEE.",10.1109/GIIS.2009.5307053,2-s2.0-71249150402,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=71249150402&origin=inward,,2.0,P2P-AIS: A P2P artificial immune systems architecture for detecting DDos flooding attacks,2009
"The current Internet is vulnerable to attacks and failures. The past events have illustrated the Internet's vulnerability to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. This paper proposes a general, and not attack specific, defense strategy through Pushback and resource regulation to mitigate the effect of such attacks. Routers cooperate with victim in implementing the defense strategy. Pushback based on the improved aggregate-based congestion control (IACC) algorithm applies to routers in order to defend bandwidth consumption attacks, while resource regulation applies to victim in order to defend resource consumption attacks. Through distributed detection and filter, the novel strategy can effectively mitigate the effect of the common DDoS attacks including the bandwidth consumption and resource consumption attacks. © 2008 IEEE.",10.1109/MMIT.2008.26,2-s2.0-70349593755,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=70349593755&origin=inward,,4.0,Mitigation of DDoS attacks through Pushback and resource regulation,2008
"© 2015 IEEE.DoS attacks are significant issues for the Internet. With huge need on internet service provided using large application server, Denial of Service (DoS) attack is developed into a key security issue in the network service provisioning. Flooding attack is one of the major DoS attacks, floods the network traffic abnormally to disturb the internet services which is rendered to users. In addition, worm attack is an impeding feature on internet peer servers on providing services to the users. Worm attack self replicates and distribute the malware across the network by its own. However, the worm detection schemes are not able to scan and detect exponentially rising abnormal traffic patterns. It is more susceptible in providing the security to the internet peer servers. DoS flooding and worm attack resistance schemes are not easy to implement because it needs large number of cooperating and monitoring activities on the services provided to the users. So, Integrated Quantum Flow and Hidden Markov Chain Approach (IQF-HMC) is designed to restrict the DDOS traffic flooding and worm attacks in internet.",10.1109/ICATCCT.2015.7456891,2-s2.0-84966665224,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84966665224&origin=inward,,2.0,A survey for restricting the DDOS traffic flooding and worm attacks in Internet,2016

"Computers and Internet have evolved into necessary tools for our professional, personal and social lives. As a result of this growing dependence, there is a concern that these systems remain protected and available. This concern increases exponentially when considering systems such as smart power grids. Therefore, research should be conducted to develop effective ways of detecting system anomalies. To have realistic results, the studies should be tested on real systems. However, it is not possible to test these experiments on the live network. With the recent collaboration of Universities and research labs, a new experiment test bed has been established. As a result, experiments can now be implemented on real networks. In our study, we design an experiment to analyze Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS Attack) on a real network with real Internet traffic. The approach that we use in our study can easily be generalized to apply to smart power grids. © 2011 ACM.",10.1145/2179298.2179388,2-s2.0-84862882993,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84862882993&origin=inward,,0.0,Security experimentation using operational systems,2011
